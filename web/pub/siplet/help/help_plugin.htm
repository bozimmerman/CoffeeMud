<h3>Plugin</h3>
A <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Plugins')">plugin</a> is represented
as a JSON document that specifies all of its features, which are
broken down below.  A minimalist plugin document looks like this:
<PRE>
{
  "name": "my minimal plugin",
  "version": 1,
  "code": "",
  "mxp":"",
  "triggers": [],
  "aliases": [],
  "timers": []
}
</PRE>
The <B>name</B> may be any string, but try to keep it unique.  <B>Version</B>
must be an integer or real number.  <B><a href="javascript:menuHelp('Mxp')">mxp</a></B> is a document of 
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Entities')">MXP tags/entities</a> that your
plugin contributes.  <B>Code</B> is your message handling 
javascript.  The API is discussed in the last section.
<P>
The <B>triggers</B> field is an array of trigger objects, each of which looks like 
this:
<PRE>
{
	"name":"my trigger",
	"regex":false,
	"pattern":"string",
	"once":true,
	"action":"displayText",
	"argument":"'hi'"
}
</PRE>
The <B>name</B> of a plugin trigger is not terribly important, but is required.  <B>Regex</B>
is true if your <B>pattern</B> is a <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Regex')">regular expression</a>, 
and false if it is a simple string.  <B>Once</B> is true if the trigger should be disabled after 
its initial match, or false to continue matching.
<P>
<B>Action</B> is one of: submitInput, displayText, playSound, setVariable, runScript,
enableTrigger, disableTrigger, startTimer, clearTimer, displayAt, submitHidden, or sendPlugin.  These,
and the required <B>argument(s)</B> are summarized in the help for  
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Actions')">Actions</a>.  Remember that an argument string must
be internally single quoted, unless it is not a string, but one of the permitted variable names.
<P>
The top level <B>aliases</B> field is an array of alias objects, each of which looks like 
this:
<PRE>
{
	"name":"my alias",
	"regex":false,
	"pattern":"string",
	"replace":"replacement string",
	"action":"displayText",
	"argument":"'hi'"
}
</PRE>
The <B>name</B>, <b>regex</b>, <B>pattern</B>, <B>action</B>, and <B>argument</B> 
of a plugin alias is the same as described above for triggers, except that the 
<b>action</b> and <b>argument</b> may be empty.  The <B>replace</B> field is
the string that replaces the user input matched by the <B>pattern</B>.
<P>
The top level <B>timers</B> field is an array of timer objects, each of which looks like 
this:
<PRE>
{
	"name":"my timer",
	"delay":0,
	"option":"once"
	"trigger":true,
	"action":"displayText"
	"argument":"'hi'"
}
</PRE>
The <B>name</B>, <B>action</B>, and <B>argument</B> 
of a plugin timer is the same as described above for triggers.  The <b>option</b>
field must be one of 'once', 'multiple', or 'repeat'; see the help on 
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Timers')">Timers</a> for more information on Options.
The <b>trigger</b> field is true if a timer begins its delay immediately, or false if
it must be externally triggered before counting down.  <B>Delay</B> is the number
of milliseconds (1000th of a second) that the timer delays for; for example, 5000
would be 5 seconds, and 60000 would be a minute.
<P>
<h3>Javascript Code</h3>
Unlike normal <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Scripts')">Scripts</a>, a plugin code
script is
sandboxed to protect the user installing it, which means that the code will not
have direct access to the mud client api or dom.  Instead it must receive information 
from a <pre>window.onevent</pre> function, and send commands to the mud using 
<pre>window.send</pre>. More detail on the types of events and the specifics
of send commands is below, but first, here is some minimal plugin code:
<PRE style="font-size:12;">
window.onevent=function(event)
{ 
  console.log("plugin received event type " + event.type);
  var response = {
    command: 'displayText',
    data: '"i received ' + event.type + '"'
  };
  window.send(response); // send the same event back 
};
</PRE>
The following are the events and event fields that might trigger the
window.onevent function for a plugin.  All events have a 'type' field,
and always a 'data' field, in addition to other 'extra' fields.
<table border=1 style="color:white;font-size:12;">
<TR><TD>Type</TD><TD>Extra</TD><TD>Description</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>connect</TD><TD></TD><TD>Connection made, with url</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>closesock</TD><TD></TD><TD>Connection lost, with url</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>close</TD><TD></TD><TD>Plugins window closing</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>msdp</TD><TD></TD><TD>MSDP message with msdp js object data</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>gmcp</TD><TD>command</TD><TD>GMCP message with js object data</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>event</TD><TD></TD><TD>Un-typed event from trigger/alias/etc</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>variable</TD><TD>key</TD><TD>Result from fetchVariable with key,data</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>?</TD><TD>?</TD><TD>Typed event from trigger/alias/etc</TD></TR>
</table> 
<P>
The following are the commands and data + other fields that can be
transmitted via window.send function for a plugin.  <b>window.send</b>
requires a json document, with a field 'command' with one of the
commands below, and almost always a 'data' field with the first
or primary argument that the command requires.  Additional fields for
secondary arguments may be required also, and are specified below.
<table border=1 style="color:white;font-size:12;">
<TR><TD>Command</TD><TD>Extra</TD><TD>Description</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>submitInput</TD><TD></TD><TD>Send data to mud server</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>displayText</TD><TD></TD><TD>Send data to mud window</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>playSound</TD><TD></TD><TD>Play sound url or name</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>setVariable</TD><TD>key</TD><TD>Sets entity/var 'key' to data value</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>enableTrigger</TD><TD></TD><TD>Enables the trigger named by data</TD></TR>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<UL>
<LI>The displayText and displayAt commands are your workhorses.  Remember that you can send
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Mxp')">MXP</a> tags and entities in the data for them, allowing you to do things like create
frames and gauges, display pictures, etc.</LI>
<LI><a href="javascript:menuHelp('Mxp')">MXP</a> Entities and connection 'variables' are the same things.  Setting a variable called
'bob' to the value 'was here' would cause the entity '&bob;' to be replaced with 'was here'.
<LI>The plugin triggers, aliases, and timers are intended to interact with each other, and 
with your script code via the Plugin Event <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Actions')">Action</a>.
