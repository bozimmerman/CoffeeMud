<h3>Window</h3>
The main window is the large text area in the middle 
of the screen where mud output will appear.  
The global settings for the main window
are located from the Global Options/Windows menu, and apply
to all MUD connections.  These settings include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Buffer Size: This is the amount of scroll-back stored for
each connection.</LI>
<LI>Text Font: The default font to use for MUD text.</LI>
<LI>Text Font Size: The default font size to use for MUD text.</LI>
<LI>Sound: A volume adjuster for any mud sounds generated.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<h3>Tabs</h3>
The Window Tab area is between the menu bar and the main text area.  
Each new mud connection will create a new tab, up to the maximum of 10.
Tabs may be closed by mousing over them and clicking the Close button, or
a lost connection restored by clicking the Reconnect button. You can
switch between tabs by clicking on them, or using ALT-1 through ALT-0.
The color of each tab gives information about the connection:
<UL>
<LI>Green: The current Active connection window is visible.
<LI>Light Green: A hidden window that is still connected, and has had
new content since it was last seen.
<LI>Yellow: A window that is attempting a new connection.
<LI>Red: A window whose connection has been lost.
<LI>Light Gray: A hidden window that is still connected, but 
has had no changes since it was last seen.
</UL>
The Window Tab area also has a black bar with a Plus + sign in it.  Clicking
this plus sign will create a new tab connection that is identical to the one
to its immediate left.  If no longer tabs exist, it will do nothing.
<P>
<h3>Protocols</h3>
The MUD Protocol features may be enabled and disabled for future connections
from the Global Options/Windows menu.  Enabling or Disabling a protocol will
have either no effect or unintended effects on existing connection windows.
These protocols include:
<UL>
<LI><a href="javascript:menuHelp('Msp')">MSP</a>: Mud Sound Protocol is the source of sound and music capabilities.</LI>
<LI><a href="javascript:menuHelp('Mxp')">MXP</a>: Mud eXtension Protocol is the source of context menus, frames, images, and 
sound capabilities.</LI>
<LI>MSDP: Mud Server Data Protocol provides a mechanism for a mud server to provide normally
hidden information to the client, and may be needed by mappers and plugins.</LI>
<LI><a href="javascript:menuHelp('Gmcp')">GMCP</a>: Generic Mud Communication Protocol is also a mechanism for a mud server to provide normally
hidden information to the client, and may be needed by mappers and plugins.</LI>
