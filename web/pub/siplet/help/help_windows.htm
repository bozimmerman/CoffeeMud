<h3>Window</h3>
The main window is the large text area in the middle 
of the screen where mud output will appear.  Its settings
are located from the Global Options/Windows menu, and apply
to all MUD connections.  These settings include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Buffer Size: This is the amount of scroll-back stored for
each connection.</LI>
<LI>Text Font: The default font to use for MUD text.</LI>
<LI>Text Font Size: The default font size to use for MUD text.</LI>
<LI>Sound: A volume adjuster for any mud sounds generated.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<h3>Tabs</h3>
The Window Tab area is between the menu bar and the main text area.  
Each new mud connection will create a new tab, up to the maximum of 10.
Tabs may be closed by mousing over them and clicking the Close button, or
a lost connection restored by clicking the Reconnect button.
The color of each tab gives information about the connection:
<UL>
<LI>Green: The current Active connection window is visible.
<LI>Light Green: A hidden window that is still connected, and has had
new content since it was last seen.
<LI>Yellow: A window that is attempting a new connection.
<LI>Red: A window whose connection has been lost.
<LI>Light Gray: A hidden window that is still connected, but 
has had no changes since it was last seen.
</UL>
The Window Tab area also has a black bar with a Plus + sign in it.  Clicking
this plus sign will create a new tab connection that is identical to the one
to its immediate left.  If no longer tabs exist, it will do nothing.
<P>
<h3>Protocols</h3>
The MUD Protocol features may be enabled and disabled for future connections
from the Global Options/Windows menu.  Enabling or Disabling a protocol will
have either no effect or unintended effects on existing connection windows.
These protocols include:
<UL>
<LI>MSP: Mud Sound Protocol is the source of sound and music capabilities.</LI>
<LI><a href="javascript:menuHelp('Mxp')">MXP</a>: Mud eXtension Protocol is the source of context menus, frames, images, and 
sound capabilities.</LI>
<LI>MSDP: Mud Server Data Protocol provides a mechanism for a mud server to provide normally
hidden information to the client, and may be needed by mappers and plugins.</LI>
<LI>GMCP: Generic Mud Communication Protocol is also a mechanism for a mud server to provide normally
hidden information to the client, and may be needed by mappers and plugins.</LI>
</UL>
