<DIV  ID="HELPROOT">
<H3>Input Entry Box</H3>
Commands can be submitted to the active mud through the large 
entry box at the bottom.  Hitting your ENTER key will send all 
of the text in the box.  Hitting SHIFT-ENTER will insert a line-break
into the box, which can be used to break up multiple commands.
<P>
Whenever a command is submitted through the entry box, it goes into
a stack of previous commands.  Using the UP/DOWN arrow keys can cycle
through these previous commands, and hitting ENTER on one of them will
re-submit that command.  
<P>
Input will always go to whichever mud is active, meaning whichever
mud has the active/green tab color. 
<P>

When dialogs are open, the TAB key can be used to navigate fields,
and the ESCape key to close an open dialog.
