<h3>Timers</h3>
An Timer is a rule that is triggered automatically after a delay following
either a connection to a mud, or another triggers'
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Action')">Action</a>, such as from an Alias, or Trigger.
<P>
Like other editors, you can customize your global Timers from the 
Global Options/Timers menu, or customize the Timers that apply only 
to the active mud window's phonebook entry through the Window/Timers menu.
<P>
The top list field in the Timers editor allows you to either begin adding a new
timer, or editing or deleting an existing one from the list.  When adding or 
editing an entry, Red fields will denote those with invalid or missing data. 
Changes to an Timer will not be submitted so long as a Red field exists. The fields are
as follows:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Name: The unique name of your Timer.  If a phonebook timer name collides with 
a global timers name, then the phonebook one will be preferred.</LI>
<LI>Delay: The amount of delay time before a timer executes its Action.</LI>
<LI>Auto-Start: Whether the timer begins its delay immediately after a mud connection,
or waits until some other triggers'
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Action')">Action</a>, such as from an Alias, or Trigger.
<LI>Options: 'Multiple' allows a timer to be started multiple times, with overlapping delays, 
while 'Once' prevents this behavior.  'Repeats' means that, once activated, a timer will re-activate
itself and delay after running its <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Action')">Action</a>.  
<LI>Action: The <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Actions')">Action</a> the timer will take after the 
delay time is concluded.
</UL>
