<h3>Aliases</h3>
An Alias is a rule that is triggered by submitting text in the 
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Input')">Input</a> box to an 
active and connected mud window.  Such rules can then alter the
text entered by the user before it is submitted to the mud, and/or
trigger some special <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Actions')">Action</a>.
<P>
Like other editors, you can customize your global Aliases from the 
Global Options/Aliases menu, or customize the Aliases that apply only 
to the active mud window's phonebook entry through the Window/Aliases menu.
<P>
The top list field in the Aliases editor allows you to either begin adding a new
alias, or editing or deleting an existing one from the list.  When adding or 
editing an entry, Red fields will denote those with invalid or missing data. 
Changes to an Alias will not be submitted so long as a Red field exists. The fields are
as follows:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Name: The unique name of your Alias.  If a phonebook alias name collides with 
a global alias name, then the phonebook one will be preferred.</LI>
<LI>Pattern: The pattern that must match the input text for it to be
replaced, or action taken.  The pattern may be a 
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Regex')">Regular Expression</a> or a simple
string that matches the beginning of the user input. All alias patterns
are case-insensitive.</LI>  
<LI>Replace: The string to replace the pattern with, when matched in user input.  If RegEx is checked,
then you may use $1, $2, etc to insert text from a capture group.  The matched and replaced
string is then the one that is submitted to the current connected mud.
<LI>Action: (Optional) Take an additional <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Actions')">Action</a>.  
</UL>
