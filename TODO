BUGS/UNTESTED STUFF:
  *.

TECH TODO:
   *. make inertia battery that alter ships inertia overall for dir change 
      (Kinetic Energy (inertia) KE=0.5*mass*velocity*velocity)
      discharge of all stored inertial power to stop the ship entirely
   *. fix drive fuel consumption!
   *. make warp engines -- see tech doc
   *. make ship active scanners
   *. make communication system
   *. navigation course system testing.
   *. When it's time to make the Real Software, good categories in tech docs
   *. make tractor beam system -- esp important for pirates!
   *. make shuttle system, ship items areas have landing zones... might require opening if exit has door?
   *. powered rideables.  ability to mount heavy gear, like engines to things.
   *. entry systems for ships (default entry key card, voice code, identifying scanner)
   *. Implement inertia/acceleration damage to the people on-board. (See StdSpaceShip gravity code)
   *. work on automatic component values ??
   *. make orbit ability, integrate with navigation: 1. go dir, 2. adjust point same dist from planet. 3. plot course.
   *. Talk to Tim: Space Tech power consumption depends on tech level of generator, panel, or interaction damage?
   *. make food generators, and refrigerators, water recycler, 
   *. turbo lift -- moveable rooms
   *. make message bouey launcher
   *. personal scanner/tricorder software: mineral scanner, computer interface (with ship perhaps?)!
   *. make transporter systems
   *. damaged systems should sometimes require random parts, from particular manufacturers, that repair respects
   *. Make SMAC that alters the ships mass, which has huge effects on drives
   *. make tech builders/players guides, how to make a ship, how to build space, etc, details about tech
   *. add spaceobject mapper system to MG
   *. keep reviewing and updating the GameOverview.html doc
   *. Giant Space Mobs! Including Space Mobs that have rooms inside.
   *. Droids! Powered slave mobs.
   *. Radiation Props: Alpha (damage), Beta (?!), Gamma (Mutation if in too long)
   *. Multiple SPACE arrays for planes of existence.

NON-TECH (Long Term) TODO:
   *. MudChat - integrate with Percolator for mood/attitude based adjective variety
   *. Builder Achievements, Archon Achievements
   *. Simple Desires quest behavior - see Tim's Wants and Needs doc
   *. Wants and Needs engine - similar to slavery system
   *. Port Siplet to C++ and shove it inside a Chromium window.
   *. Start on Spell Research?
   *. OLC for players?  Play with PennMush more. Port 4201
   *. Finish Player Simulator -- the Perpetual Project
   *. MudFTP/DawnFTP support - lets you edit room descriptions etc. in your favourite text editor, or just for fun
   *. Clan Calendar system, that can use mud and rl dates, for scheduling things. Might send reminders -- based on journaling system of course.
