# Build 5.2.10 Released Dec 11, 2006
   1. Internal: New Libraries: Law
   2. New Behavior: Nanny -- for easily automating watching over children, mounts, or followers for gold by the hour.
   3. New Scriptable trigger: IMASK_PROG (a mask prog that only responds to scripted mob)
   4. New Scriptable function: ISLIKE (for doing zapper mask checks on object)
   5. New Scriptable commands: MPUNLOADSCRIPT (an unload for scriptable files only); MPSTEPQUEST
   6. Scriptable change: MPGSET/MPSETting a mobs level will rescore it, changing race resizes it
   7. MudChat now has a "Quest" syntax for additing entries
   8. Arrest changes: trespassing now also includes being a foreign aggro mob not following a player
   9. Arrest changes: being wanted for resisting arrest now starts the "copkiller" effect (police don't follow normal procedure)
  10. Behavior MOBTeachers now teach Expertises
  11. Quest changes: now support multi-step quests, spawned quests, multi-quest spawned scripts, AREAGROUPs, and GIVE STATs
  12. Internal: New message type: LIFE (is sent when mobs are rejuved or initially brought into a map)
  13. GTELL now supports socials/emotes, and automatically emotes a LEVEL msg when a group member levels

  16. Dozens of new skill, chant, prayer -domains implemented
  17. SNOOPED players will be tagged with their snoopitude names
  18. We now have a AUTO-player-TITLING system -- just use CREATE TITLE to get started
  19. I3 now connects to the new server, and their are coffeemud.ini entries to specify servers

  25. Generic Races - CREATE RACE <RACEID> can now be used to CONVERT existing standard races to genraces.  This is a very faithful copy system.
  26. Generic Classes - CREATE CLASS <CLASSID> can now be used to CONVERT existing standard char classes to gencharclasses.  Not as faithful a copy as genraces due to the complexity of gencharclass code.
  27. Saving a room with items riding rideables will have ride-status be rememberd and restored on room reload, including riding items like wagons on horzes.
  28. Most java classes can be reloaded at run-time; the LOAD command will unload existing classes from the classloader first, so UNLOAD not necessary.  This includes .class files, .js (javascript) classes, and if setup correctly, .java files will be recompiled and loaded.
  29. As mentioned previously -- scripts directory eliminated and language scripts folded back into java code.  This is a linguistic surrender to a massive codebase that I can't maintain in an abstract language-scripted form.
  30. DESTROY now supports THREAD type -- doesn't always work for all threads though as thread.stop() is deprecated..
  31. CoffeeMud now has numerous skill-tied Expertises, as well as ability to define/destroy them online -- use CREATE/LIST EXPERTISE to get started

  39. ANNOUNCEMSG (no parm) now reveals existing announce message
  40. Don't normally announce bugs, but the one related to the MUDGRinder menu for non-archons was a doozy. Some may look at it now and wonder at all the "new" editors in there.
  41. can now TRANSFER large chunks of items from one place to another.
  42. Prop_SpellAdder (and derivatimes -- PropFightSpellCast, etc -- supports NOUNINVOKE flag now)
  43. Several new DEBUG coffeemud.ini entries for your amusement
  44. New Prayer: ROT (counter to good prayer)
  45. CoffeeMud now stores backup of player kids in database. Resurrect prayer can be used to bring then back, esp. when used by an Archon

  54. New resource type: BEANS

  56. Archon wands/staffs now both have level x up/down ability as well as RESTORE ability
  57. Can now delete directories in MUDGrinder File Manager
  58. MUDGrinder FLAT-Map area editor uses a new algorithm for placing rooms that GREATLY improves readability
  59. Yet another step taken towards the "Multi-Host" MUD abilities -- still not there by a longshot, but more work done in that direction.
  60. Mechanism for how standard races set their "default stats" (the way birds have an int of 1, for instance) was changed to be a bit more flexible, to allow higher stats in extreme circumstances
  61. Really a consequence of the GenRace changes, but auto-Mixed races (from breeding) will be a much more accurate mix of the races now.
  62. Prancer class renamed to Dancer
  63. Special/Reserved Quest called holidays can be added to/modified on an area-by-area basis using LIST/CREATE/MODIFY HOLIDAY <name>

# Build 5.1.5 - Released Jul 26, 2006
  MCCP is now disabled in the coffeemud. ini file by default. What I thought was a really frisky bug in CoffeeMud turned out to be a problem in the zlib.jar file we are using. The bug causes player output lockup about once per day on my mud. I recommend you disable it until I can replace the library.
  Also, I did get primary hacking on the Mystery Engine completed, but will have to wait for the next build to see the debugged version with lots of example mystery quests.
  As always, this build is in the "stable" directory.

# Build 5.1.3 - Released Apr 24, 2006
   1. Armor can now be layered (more than one thing worn on a location)
   2. Armor can be layered and see-through (like cloth armband around a shirt sleeve)

   4. Prop_WearAdjuster/Prop_WearEnabler have a new flag: LAYERED to limit layered magic armaments
   5. Common skills updated for layered clothing -- thanks Tim!

# Build 5.1.2 - Released Apr 04, 2006
  numerous important bug fixes, as a few remaining problems with thin areas are shaken out. Even if you don't use thin areas, you'll need the fixes, since they also resolved issues with Grids.
  The only real new feature is the implementation of Educations. In this case, for the common skills.
  And, of course, assorted other fixes.
# Build 5.1.0 - Released Mar 23, 2006
  Here it is, and every bit as late as I promised. Hopefully something in there yall will like. As always, there are INI changes to watch out for, and another library JAR file has been added which needs to be included in your startup script (mud.bat or whatever).
   1. New Area types. These include grid type areas, uncached (thin) areas, and combinations of both. (see Archons Guide) 2. MUDGrinder support for "grid" area types -- supports "painting"
   huge swabs of rooms at once.
   3. Languages being spoken can now cause problems for ORDERing, and Shopkeeper/Banker/Postman interactions.
   4. Serious optomizations in all tracking-related behaviors and skills.
   5. New command: Replay (sort of a command-line scrollbar) 6. Many common skills now have attribute and other skill and proficiency requirements. This is the stick -- the next version will have tons of enhancements to them through Education flags.
   7. Default non-combat commands & skills/round changed from 4 to 10 and 4 to 6 respectively (in INI file).
   8. A first in the history of CoffeeMud! An INI entry has been REMOVED (MINMOVETIME). It's redundant now with the round timing code.
   9. New INI entry: AUTOAREAPROPS for automatically adding properties or behaviors to new/old Areas.
  10. Disease Obesity has been toned down slightly. No pun intended.
  11. Some networking issues with the HTTP/web server have been worked out. Pretty important bug fix.
  12. Prop_ReqCapacity has a new parameter: indoor 13. Skills/Spells/etc can now have requirements that include: other skills, proficiency in other skills, and ANY other Zapper masks.
  These requirements can be built on a class-by-class basis instead of being global to a skill.
  14. ItemGenerator behavior now weighs its random selections by value (more valuable == less likely) 15. MudChat behavior can now have combat-only message/response handling.
  16. You can now export and import areas from the MUDGrinder.
  17. RUNning is now faster than walking around, though its more expensive of movement.
  18. Player Records now have a "notes" field you can jot misc stuff into about them.
  19. Quests (the automated of course) can now have a priority/run level set to prevent them from overlapping.
  20. Quests can also have minimum players online, which can be narrowly defined using a player zappermask if you like.
  21. CoffeeMud now supports MCCP (text compression), and it supports it reliably and well. There is another jar file in the LIB directory to make sure is in the classpath, however.
  22. DEFAULT PROMPT now includes the combat opponents health text.
     It was removed from its previous place. Old players will have to update their prompts.
  23. Due to the mudmagic.com coding context, CoffeeMud now has a configurable and expandable Extended English Parsing system. You can enter all kinds of complex things like: get the third axe ; get the axe and the sword ; get the sword and wield it ; get sword, axe, and helmet and put all in the bag 24. Zapper mask now includes SKILLS (including optional proficiency checks), EDUCATIONS, SECURITY flags (but only if they are defined in your ini file) 25. (Internal) CoffeeMud is now FAR stingier with threads, and has been drastically optimized for speed without costing another byte in memory (heck, perhaps using even less in the process).
  26. If your muds been up long enough, you can actually start reviewing your players leveling-dates from the MUDGrinder Player List.
  27. Siplet also supports MCCP now, and has had a few Firefox/Browser related issues addressed.
  28. The MUDGrinder main menu has been shuffled a tiny bit. A minor change to the Threads listing makes it a bit more useful.
  29. A whole circus of bugs tamed, and hopefully as few new ones introduced as possible.
# Build 5.0.1 - Released Jan 18, 2006
   A few bug fixes as 5. 0 is preped for public announcement.
# Build 5.0.0 - Released Jan 14, 2006
   This is mostly just from memory. ..
   1. Packages have been moved around, fakedb files are now in a different place, and there have been INI file changes -- follow the Installation Guide upgrade instructions closely!
   2. Some speed and memory usage enhancements.
   3. Smoking can give you cancer now.
   4. New CoffeeMud file system, with new command SHELL and new MUDGrinder File Browser to support it. Remember that "." is a shortcut for the SHELL command. Also remember that all your files must be in the coffeemud installed directory now! Also, new security flags, VFS: and FS: implemented to allow you to give file level or directory level access to builders. Do Help CMFS for more info.
   5. Better builder reporting in the log.
   6. CoffeeMud classloader will now load JavaScript ".js" classes also.
      See the Programmer's Guide for more information.
   7. Many, but not all, interfaces have been commented. Generating javadocs might actually be useful!
   8. New Behaviors: ItemGenerator, and RandomItems
   9. Metacraft has some more parameters to extend its usefulness
  10. New actions/time-based commands support. INI entries DEFCOMCMDTIME and DEFCMDTIME and DEFCOMABLETIME and DEFABLETIME to support it. My own players preferred a lower DEFABLETIME -- you might want to tinker with that setting to taste (I set mine from .25 to .1)
  11. Trailto command has more options now.
  12. New INI entries: LIBRARY, COMMON to support extended engine library classpaths
  13. INI entry change: COMBATSYSTEM now has new entry: MANUAL.
  Internally, abilities now have preinvoke methods, and commands have preexecute.
  14. Lots of other stuff I can't remember, and with a 15megabyte change file, I may never know about.
  15. Somewhere, there are fixed bugs.
# Build 4.7.13 - Release Dec 1, 2005
  Somewhat early build as I figure out what's next.

# Build 4.7.12 - Release Nov 12, 2005
  Not a long list, but a fun one. I've spent almost the entire last
  three weeks working on Siplet -- the built in java applet-based
  client. It's now very close to where I want it... at least close
  enough that I managed to put SOME time in on the engine. :)
   1. ALLSKILLS Security flag added as an alternative means of giving
   admins all skills short of making Archons or new classes.
   2. CoffeeMud SMTP server will now react more favorably to HTML-
   formatted emails, provided they also include a text part.
   3. Emoter behavior now supports socials proper.
   4. New text file: mxp_images.ini which, because I don't have sample
      images yet, doesn't do much. It's an empty template for all the
      default MXP compliant images that can be used in-game whenever an
      object-specific image isn't provided by builders.
   5. LIST RACECATS command added, along with LIST MATERIALS.
   6. CoffeeMud now does a bit more TELNET-code negotiation, and does it
      in a nicer fashion. Special thanks to Alan Wood for providing the
      code that inspired it. The only functional bonus, per se, is that
      people using straight TELNET will get character echo so they can see
      what they type.
   7. New player command: VISIBLE, which also works for Archons WIZI
      purposes.
   8. Siplet client now supports as much of the MXP protocol as
      CoffeeMud dishes out. :)
   9. New property: Prop_RoomUnmappable
  10. *Modified* Scriptable commands: MPECHOAT, NUMMOBROOM -- now both
      much more powerful
  11. FakeDB now supports a WHERE clause with other comparisons aside
      from just =: >, <, <=, >=, and <>
  12. New spells: Word of Recall, Mana Shield, Minor Mana Shield, and
      Major Mana Shield
  13. <internal> Shutdown app now works using an escape sequence, so
      the new Shutdown app is NOT backwards compat with old servers.
  14. Quests can now have static start dates, both real-life dates, and
      mud-dates.
  15. StdThinGridVacuum has been reactivated. I think I finally got
      its problems licked.
  16. New intro screen for MXP client users -- they will see intro.jpg
      in addition to intro. txt
  17. A growth of malignant bugs was eradiated.
# Build 4.7.11 - Released Oct 28, 2005
   1. Date/Time records for each level a player gains, including their creation data/time, are now kept.
   2. New Zapper checks: season, month, hour

   8. New Archon LIST entries: JOURNALS, TITLES
   9. Can now destroy entire journals with DESTROY JOURNAL
  10. ShopKeepers can now enforce a level range on items bought with new RANGE prejudice factor.
  11. Command Line Socials editor totally rewritten.
  12. Socials can now include arbitrary second parameter... not just SELF, <T-NAME>, but ALL or any other second word.
  13. New player command: AUTOAFFECTS
  14. ShopKeepers will now accept items to sell from property owners if their "home room" is player or clan property. Proceeds from such sales go directly into the property owners local bank accounts, if any.
  15. Several more commands have been "scriptified" -- thanks again to Gianluca for his continued hard work.
  16. Prop_Retainable has been greatly enhanced -- it is practically a new property, and makes player owned payed-one-time laborers much easier to handle.
  17. New player command: ALIAS
  18. New web player menu: Player Access, which gives players their char stats and other goodies, including email.
  19. EMAIL command has been rewritten to allow accessing player email even with AUTOFORWARD flag is off.
  20. AddFile web macro now has WEBIFY MacParm to translate color and other MUD codes.
  21. Regional Awareness skill now shows maps in color! woohoo!
  22. PK rule changes: players can not turn PK flag off, or log off within a few minutes of a fight with another player.
  23. New behavior: ScriptableEverymob, for having ALL mobs in a given area share a Scriptable script.
  24. Socials now also include MSP sound files. Numerous socials have been outfitted -- THANKS JORDANA!!!!
  25. Weather events, and numerous previously silent spells now have accompanying files -- thanks AGAIN to Jordana!
  26. Common Skills now are mostly outfitted with sounds.
  27. CoffeeMud now has an official web-based client available to Internet Explorer users via your internal web servers public pages. No MXP support yet, but it does have MSP sound support, ANSI support, and "up arrow" command memory.
  28. A horde of marauding bugs beaten back with the ingenious use of banana peels and cat droppings.
# Build 4.7.10 - Release Oct 11, 2005
  Bug fixes to StdShopkeeper and BaseGenerics.
# Build 4.7.9 - Released Oct 10, 2005

      Prop_*Resister, etc. . may now include an optional zapper mask to
      determine if the described bonuses will apply to the current
      user/wearer/rider/owner/whatever. This is great for making armor
      that only works when all pieces are worn, or axes with bonuses only

      worth mentioning.
  13. Journal-type items can now have an administrator listed in their
      parameters along with REPLY, READ, and WRITE requirements.
  14. ANNOUNCE command changes: announce alone defaults to ALL.
      ANNOUNCETO syntax required to direct an announcement. ANNOUNCEMSG
      allows admins to customize the string outputted when they use the
      command.
  15. Color of fight text now differs for strings reflecting your own
      attacks versus those of others. ColorSet expanded accordingly.
  16. AFK command now has an optional parameter for when people try to
      do TELLs to you.
  17. Highly dangerous new Archon command: PAUSE. Can be directed to
      stop thread/ticking of individual objects, OR THE ENTIRE MUD!!!!!
  18. Internal: Gianluca managed to scriptify the BaseGenerics.java
      file -- all the command line editors basically. What a feat....
  19. Internal: New string tag: <S-NAMENOART> <T-NAMENOART> <O-
      NAMENOART> to automatically remove any prefix english articles from
      names before displaying them.

      will be apparant.

      minutes.

      multiplaying and new-player spamming
  29. File Browser in MUDGrinder now has filename search, and file
      search features

  31. sumbugzfixt
# Build 4.7.7 - Released Sep 24, 2005

  I'd like to give KUDOs to Gianluca of Italy. He's been working with

Alignment has been changed to a faction, and is defined in your resources directory in a file called alignment.ini.

# Build 4.6.10 - Released Dec 12, 2004
  There is a new INI entry "MUDTHEME" which everyone MUST include in their on INI files and set to "1". Other than that, it serves no purpose as of yet... it's just a placeholder for features that exist merely as pipe-dreams.
  Those features which are not pipe-dreams are listed below:
   1. Improved docs for the new databases, thanks Mathew

   5. Internal: 10-directions stubbed in. All that's left is for someone to code the commands and call Directions.ReInitialize. Some extra coding is likely required, but at least there's a basis for others to play with.

# Build 4.6.8 - Released Nov 27, 2004
  *  This version only has MXP support implemented. The configuration file for it is located in resources/text/mxp.txt
  * The image download feature in ZMUD failed horribly for me, so I only inserted one image-ready tag (ScoreImg) in the codebase, and then commented out its implementation in mxp. txt so as not to crash ZMUD for other people as well. I notified ZMUD of the bug. Lord only knows if they care. :)
  * If there are any other bug fixes or changes, they weren't really worth mentioning. MXP was my only focus.

  20. GenCharClasses created. Although I personally did not expect much use from it, one of my builders suggested that these could be a great tool not only for CM customizers, but for builders who want to create skill templates for their mobs. Anyway, just thought I'd pass that thought on.
  21. And, as always, lots and lots and lots of bugs fixed.

   8. Fixes in MOBEater and CombatAbilities (specifically with wand use) make those behaviors much more useful.
   9. Minor changes in rejuv rates for hp/mana/mov weigh more heavily now on stats than on level. Not changing this when coffeemud went from a 25 level system to a 100+ system was an oversight.
