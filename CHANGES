  27. Saving a room with items riding rideables will have ride-status be rememberd and restored on room reload, including riding items like wagons on horzes.
  28. Most java classes can be reloaded at run-time; the LOAD command will unload existing classes from the classloader first, so UNLOAD not necessary.  This includes .class files, .js (javascript) classes, and if setup correctly, .java files will be recompiled and loaded.

  60. Mechanism for how standard races set their "default stats" (the way birds have an int of 1, for instance) was changed to be a bit more flexible, to allow higher stats in extreme circumstances
  61. Really a consequence of the GenRace changes, but auto-Mixed races (from breeding) will be a much more accurate mix of the races now.

  33. So many bugs were fixed, it would hurt us both to list them.
# Build 5.1.3 - Released Apr 24, 2006
   1. Armor can now be layered (more than one thing worn on a location)
   2. Armor can be layered and see-through (like cloth armband around a shirt sleeve)
   3. Armor can now be layered and multi-worn (like bracelets on a wrist, or badges on a shirt)
   4. Prop_WearAdjuster/Prop_WearEnabler have a new flag: LAYERED to limit layered magic armaments
   5. Common skills updated for layered clothing -- thanks Tim!
   6. New player race: Drow (still in beta though -- probably more will be done with it): Thanks Lee!
   7. Racketeering now prevents other thieves from harassing your protected shopkeepers: Thanks again Lee!
   8. Better support for Oracle is on the way -- partially there this release, but not all the way there. Thanks Aristotle!
   9. Spell_MagicItem now has protections for layered clothing (to prevent abuse)
  10. Not new, but in better shape: educations for using common skills to create enhanced items
     -- mobteachers especially are more helpful. :)
  11. Evil clerics now OUTFIT with swords instead of maces
  12. New resource: cheese. :/
  13. TELL now respects invisibility
  14. New Zapper masks: ADJSTR, ADJDEX, ADJCON, etc.. for adjusted/current stat checking
  15. A tall helping of bugs gobbled up.
# Build 5.1.2 - Released Apr 04, 2006
  numerous important bug fixes, as a few remaining problems with thin areas are shaken out. Even if you don't use thin areas, you'll need the fixes, since they also resolved issues with Grids.
  The only real new feature is the implementation of Educations. In this case, for the common skills.
  And, of course, assorted other fixes.
# Build 5.1.0 - Released Mar 23, 2006
  Here it is, and every bit as late as I promised. Hopefully something in there yall will like. As always, there are 
  INI changes to watch out for, and another library JAR file has been added which needs to be included in your startup 
  script (mud.bat or whatever).
   1. New Area types. These include grid type areas, uncached (thin) areas, and combinations of both. 
     (see Archons Guide) 
   2. MUDGrinder support for "grid" area types -- supports "painting" huge swabs of rooms at once.
   3. Languages being spoken can now cause problems for ORDERing, and Shopkeeper/Banker/Postman interactions.
   4. Serious optomizations in all tracking-related behaviors and skills.
   5. New command: Replay (sort of a command-line scrollbar) 
   6. Many common skills now have attribute and other skill and proficiency requirements. This is the stick -- 
      the next version will have tons of enhancements to them through Education flags.
   7. Default non-combat commands & skills/round changed from 4 to 10 and 4 to 6 respectively (in INI file).
   8. A first in the history of CoffeeMud! An INI entry has been REMOVED (MINMOVETIME). It's redundant now with the round timing code.
   9. New INI entry: AUTOAREAPROPS for automatically adding properties or behaviors to new/old Areas.
  10. Disease Obesity has been toned down slightly. No pun intended.
  11. Some networking issues with the HTTP/web server have been worked out. Pretty important bug fix.
  12. Prop_ReqCapacity has a new parameter: indoor 
  13. Skills/Spells/etc can now have requirements that include: other skills, proficiency in other skills, 
      and ANY other Zapper masks.  These requirements can be built on a class-by-class basis instead of 
      being global to a skill.
  14. ItemGenerator behavior now weighs its random selections by value (more valuable == less likely) 
  15. MudChat behavior can now have combat-only message/response handling.
  16. You can now export and import areas from the MUDGrinder.
  17. RUNning is now faster than walking around, though its more expensive of movement.
  18. Player Records now have a "notes" field you can jot misc stuff into about them.
  19. Quests (the automated of course) can now have a priority/run level set to prevent them from overlapping.
  20. Quests can also have minimum players online, which can be narrowly defined using a player zappermask if you like.
  21. CoffeeMud now supports MCCP (text compression), and it supports it reliably and well. There is another jar file 
      in the LIB directory to make sure is in the classpath, however.
  22. DEFAULT PROMPT now includes the combat opponents health text.
     It was removed from its previous place. Old players will have to update their prompts.
  23. Due to the mudmagic.com coding context, CoffeeMud now has a configurable and expandable Extended English Parsing 
      system. You can enter all kinds of complex things like: get the third axe ; get the axe and the sword ; get the 
      sword and wield it ; get sword, axe, and helmet and put all in the bag 
  24. Zapper mask now includes SKILLS (including optional proficiency checks), EDUCATIONS, SECURITY flags (but only 
      if they are defined in your ini file) 
  25. (Internal) CoffeeMud is now FAR stingier with threads, and has been drastically optimized for speed without costing another byte in memory (heck, perhaps using even less in the process).
  26. If your muds been up long enough, you can actually start reviewing your players leveling-dates from the 
      MUDGrinder Player List.
  27. Siplet also supports MCCP now, and has had a few Firefox/Browser related issues addressed.
  28. The MUDGrinder main menu has been shuffled a tiny bit. A minor change to the Threads listing makes it a bit 
      more useful.
  29. A whole circus of bugs tamed, and hopefully as few new ones introduced as possible.
# Build 5.0.1 - Released Jan 18, 2006
   A few bug fixes as 5. 0 is preped for public announcement.
# Build 5.0.0 - Released Jan 14, 2006
   This is mostly just from memory. ..
   1. Packages have been moved around, fakedb files are now in a different place, and there have been INI file 
      changes -- follow the Installation Guide upgrade instructions closely!
   2. Some speed and memory usage enhancements.
   3. Smoking can give you cancer now.
   4. New CoffeeMud file system, with new command SHELL and new MUDGrinder File Browser to support it. 
      Remember that "." is a shortcut for the SHELL command. Also remember that all your files must be in the 
      coffeemud installed directory now! Also, new security flags, VFS: and FS: implemented to allow you to give 
      file level or directory level access to builders. Do Help CMFS for more info.
   5. Better builder reporting in the log.
   6. CoffeeMud classloader will now load JavaScript ".js" classes also.
      See the Programmer's Guide for more information.
   7. Many, but not all, interfaces have been commented. Generating javadocs might actually be useful!
   8. New Behaviors: ItemGenerator, and RandomItems
   9. Metacraft has some more parameters to extend its usefulness
  10. New actions/time-based commands support. INI entries DEFCOMCMDTIME and DEFCMDTIME and DEFCOMABLETIME and 
      DEFABLETIME to support it. My own players preferred a lower DEFABLETIME -- you might want to tinker with that 
      setting to taste (I set mine from .25 to .1)
  11. Trailto command has more options now.
  12. New INI entries: LIBRARY, COMMON to support extended engine library classpaths
  13. INI entry change: COMBATSYSTEM now has new entry: MANUAL.
  Internally, abilities now have preinvoke methods, and commands have preexecute.
  14. Lots of other stuff I can't remember, and with a 15megabyte change file, I may never know about.
  15. Somewhere, there are fixed bugs.
# Build 4.7.13 - Release Dec 1, 2005
  Somewhat early build as I figure out what's next.
  **VERY IMPORTANT** No DB changes, but launching the mud now requires
  that you include lib/js. jar in your classpath. All of the sample
  batch files have been adjusted accordingly. There are also a INI
  entries to watch out for if you upgrade.
   1. New global color code: ^J for weather messages.
   2. Siplet now detects browser java installation and gives a message
      for those without.
   3. Scriptable changes: NUMMOBSROOM accepts a name parameter, new
      MPRESET command, new <SCRIPT> command (see 7)
   4. More interesting information about death is recorded in DeadBody
      objects now, with GenEditor support.
   5. New memory management tool: LIST OBJCOUNTERS
   6. Relationship between Hide and See Hidden altered. Success at
      either is now modified by level, skill, 2 new saving throws (save vs
      detection, save vs overlooking), height, dexterity, wisdom.
   7. Scriptable behavior, Quest engine, web pages all support
      Javascripting. New INI entry controls security for Scriptable
      behavior.
   8. New command: JRUN, for executing external-file javascript, for
      batch or other purposes.
   9. Skill Usage report added to the Statistics tables in the MUDGrinder
  10. Lots of default MXP images are included in this build.. almost
      all races, but some resources as well. Almost all were collected by
      the wonderous Jordana.
  11. The formula used to determine hits and misses in combat has been
      altered to correct some imbalances and improve gameplay.
  12. Two weapon fighting altered to make it desirable for players,
      while (hopefully) maintaining balance.
  13. Injury system now includes a minimum level to lose a body part,
      specifyable in the INI file.
  14. Internal: Most shopkeeper code from Merchant and StdShopKeeper
      consolodated into CoffeeShop object and CoffeeShops library
  15. Merchant common skill can now be used as a property also. See
      AHELP MERCHANT for more info, but basically you can make anything
      from an item, to a room, to a whole area into a shop.
  16. FLEE command can now be used to end combat when all your foes are
      bound, sleeping, or held.
  17. Scriptable: Previously mentioned changes to speech_prog and
      regmask_prog. See yahoo support group.
  18. New command: GMODIFY, which allows searches and replaces in
      objects by stat fields.
  19. Locksmith skill now supports DELOCK parameter.
  20. 1/2 cup of debug labor sprikled within 1 foot radius of entire
      bug mound. Approx 1 qt of water per cup of debugging.
# Build 4.7.12 - Release Nov 12, 2005
  Not a long list, but a fun one. I've spent almost the entire last
  three weeks working on Siplet -- the built in java applet-based
  client. It's now very close to where I want it... at least close
  enough that I managed to put SOME time in on the engine. :)
   1. ALLSKILLS Security flag added as an alternative means of giving
   admins all skills short of making Archons or new classes.
   2. CoffeeMud SMTP server will now react more favorably to HTML-
   formatted emails, provided they also include a text part.
   3. Emoter behavior now supports socials proper.
   4. New text file: mxp_images.ini which, because I don't have sample
      images yet, doesn't do much. It's an empty template for all the
      default MXP compliant images that can be used in-game whenever an
      object-specific image isn't provided by builders.
   5. LIST RACECATS command added, along with LIST MATERIALS.
   6. CoffeeMud now does a bit more TELNET-code negotiation, and does it
      in a nicer fashion. Special thanks to Alan Wood for providing the
      code that inspired it. The only functional bonus, per se, is that
      people using straight TELNET will get character echo so they can see
      what they type.
   7. New player command: VISIBLE, which also works for Archons WIZI
      purposes.
   8. Siplet client now supports as much of the MXP protocol as
      CoffeeMud dishes out. :)
   9. New property: Prop_RoomUnmappable
  10. *Modified* Scriptable commands: MPECHOAT, NUMMOBROOM -- now both
      much more powerful
  11. FakeDB now supports a WHERE clause with other comparisons aside
      from just =: >, <, <=, >=, and <>
  12. New spells: Word of Recall, Mana Shield, Minor Mana Shield, and
      Major Mana Shield
  13. <internal> Shutdown app now works using an escape sequence, so
      the new Shutdown app is NOT backwards compat with old servers.
  14. Quests can now have static start dates, both real-life dates, and
      mud-dates.
  15. StdThinGridVacuum has been reactivated. I think I finally got
      its problems licked.
  16. New intro screen for MXP client users -- they will see intro.jpg
      in addition to intro. txt
  17. A growth of malignant bugs was eradiated.
# Build 4.7.11 - Released Oct 28, 2005
   1. Date/Time records for each level a player gains, including their creation data/time, are now kept.
   2. New Zapper checks: season, month, hour

   4. WHO command extended with optional PLAYERKILL parameter
   5. Individual Abilities and Commands can now be disabled via the INI file, if for some reason you want to do that.
   6. New Clan trophy (Most Rival player-kills). Damn, don't think I tested that.... :/
   7. Looking up into or across SKY areas can now tell you of mobs and items "out there".
   8. New Archon LIST entries: JOURNALS, TITLES
   9. Can now destroy entire journals with DESTROY JOURNAL
  10. ShopKeepers can now enforce a level range on items bought with new RANGE prejudice factor.
  11. Command Line Socials editor totally rewritten.
  12. Socials can now include arbitrary second parameter... not just SELF, <T-NAME>, but ALL or any other second word.
  13. New player command: AUTOAFFECTS
  14. ShopKeepers will now accept items to sell from property owners if their "home room" is player or clan property. Proceeds from such sales go directly into the property owners local bank accounts, if any.
  15. Several more commands have been "scriptified" -- thanks again to Gianluca for his continued hard work.
  16. Prop_Retainable has been greatly enhanced -- it is practically a new property, and makes player owned payed-one-time laborers much easier to handle.
  17. New player command: ALIAS
  18. New web player menu: Player Access, which gives players their char stats and other goodies, including email.
  19. EMAIL command has been rewritten to allow accessing player email even with AUTOFORWARD flag is off.
  20. AddFile web macro now has WEBIFY MacParm to translate color and other MUD codes.
  21. Regional Awareness skill now shows maps in color! woohoo!
  22. PK rule changes: players can not turn PK flag off, or log off within a few minutes of a fight with another player.
  23. New behavior: ScriptableEverymob, for having ALL mobs in a given area share a Scriptable script.
  24. Socials now also include MSP sound files. Numerous socials have been outfitted -- THANKS JORDANA!!!!
  25. Weather events, and numerous previously silent spells now have accompanying files -- thanks AGAIN to Jordana!
  26. Common Skills now are mostly outfitted with sounds.
  27. CoffeeMud now has an official web-based client available to Internet Explorer users via your internal web servers public pages. No MXP support yet, but it does have MSP sound support, ANSI support, and "up arrow" command memory.
  28. A horde of marauding bugs beaten back with the ingenious use of banana peels and cat droppings.
# Build 4.7.10 - Release Oct 11, 2005
  Bug fixes to StdShopkeeper and BaseGenerics.
# Build 4.7.9 - Released Oct 10, 2005
  here were a few really nasty bugs discovered soon after the release of
  4. 7.8. This build corrects them.
# Build 4.7.8 - Released Oct 07, 2005
   1. Built in channels WIZINFO and CLANTALK are *GONE*. They have been
      replaced with new CHANNELS flags in the INI file. Please see the INI

      information they couldn't before.
   3. Those with CLOAKING ability can now auto-cloak at login by putting
      their login name followed by a space and a '!' character during login.
   4. Unless disabled, the system will now keep track of every room a

      and will report the % of the current area and world visited in the
      WHERE command.
   5. Many properties Prop_*SpellCast, Prop_*Adjuster, Prop_*Enabler,
      Prop_*Resister, etc. . may now include an optional zapper mask to
      determine if the described bonuses will apply to the current
      user/wearer/rider/owner/whatever. This is great for making armor
      that only works when all pieces are worn, or axes with bonuses only
      for dwarves, etc.
   6. Readable items may now be written/read in different languages.
      SPEAK command will choose what language will be WRITTEN in.
   7. New unlisted command: Test -- written just for automatiting the
      testing of all the property changes mentioned in #5.
   8. Light sources can now be handled in limited ways, even in the dark.
   9. Looking at a rideable will now list the people riding it.
  10. WillQualify command will now report which skills are
      automatically gained.
  11. A name mask can now be given to the IMPORT command when importing
      player lists.
  12. genCharClass command line editor FINALLY supports the
      availability flag properly. This was really a bug fix, but well
      worth mentioning.
  13. Journal-type items can now have an administrator listed in their
      parameters along with REPLY, READ, and WRITE requirements.
  14. ANNOUNCE command changes: announce alone defaults to ALL.
      ANNOUNCETO syntax required to direct an announcement. ANNOUNCEMSG
      allows admins to customize the string outputted when they use the
      command.
  15. Color of fight text now differs for strings reflecting your own
      attacks versus those of others. ColorSet expanded accordingly.
  16. AFK command now has an optional parameter for when people try to
      do TELLs to you.
  17. Highly dangerous new Archon command: PAUSE. Can be directed to
      stop thread/ticking of individual objects, OR THE ENTIRE MUD!!!!!
  18. Internal: Gianluca managed to scriptify the BaseGenerics.java
      file -- all the command line editors basically. What a feat....
  19. Internal: New string tag: <S-NAMENOART> <T-NAMENOART> <O-
      NAMENOART> to automatically remove any prefix english articles from
      names before displaying them.
  20. New command: PACKAGE. Just read the help -- it's purpose and use
      will be apparant.
  21. New Scriptable command: MPSTOP, to hault mob fighting and common
      skill using.

  26. Maximum rate of skill improvement slowed from 1/minute to 1/5
      minutes.
  27. LOTS of new MXP tags added, especially to SCORE, archon WHERE
  28. new INI entries: MAXCONNSPERIP, MAXNEWPERIP to control
      multiplaying and new-player spamming
  29. File Browser in MUDGrinder now has filename search, and file
      search features
  30. Archons can now see the mundane WHERE text by doing WHERE !
  31. sumbugzfixt
# Build 4.7.7 - Released Sep 24, 2005

  tinkering. Several class files were dropped, so make sure you follow

  *  A New Table was added to the Database ** If you intend to use
  the new polling feature, make SURE you review the Installation Guide
  instructions regarding upgrading a database-change version before
  downloading and installing build 4. 7.6
  I'd like to give KUDOs to Gianluca of Italy. He's been working with
  me on "scriptizing" CoffeeMud to support other languages. That means
  you'll find several more entries in the EN_TX scripts area of the

   1. AHELP command and MUDGrinder Archon Help topics now actually

      circumstance.

# Build 4.7.4 - Released Jul 17, 2005
  Probably one of the smallest builds released. Normally one I would
  hold for another week or two, but for some of the bug fixes. The
  change file only had 3000 lines totally 136k on disk. The new stuff
  is really light, but here it is. ..
   1. Thief Tag Turf skill now lets them tag for their clan, and remove
      tags.
   2. Several of the home-protecting prayers and spells now have a clan
      component.

      mob aggr to the caster so long as he/she is under its affect.

# Build 4.6.10 - Released Dec 12, 2004
  There is a new INI entry "MUDTHEME" which everyone MUST include in their on INI files and set to "1". Other than that, it serves no purpose as of yet... it's just a placeholder for features that exist merely as pipe-dreams.

# Build 4.6.8 - Released Nov 27, 2004
  *  This version only has MXP support implemented. The configuration file for it is located in resources/text/mxp.txt
  * The image download feature in ZMUD failed horribly for me, so I only inserted one image-ready tag (ScoreImg) in the codebase, and then commented out its implementation in mxp. txt so as not to crash ZMUD for other people as well. I notified ZMUD of the bug. Lord only knows if they care. :)
  * If there are any other bug fixes or changes, they weren't really worth mentioning. MXP was my only focus.

   9. Minor changes in rejuv rates for hp/mana/mov weigh more heavily now on stats than on level. Not changing this when coffeemud went from a 25 level system to a 100+ system was an oversight.
