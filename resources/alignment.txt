Your alignment represents your moral fiber, with Good representing selfless benevolence, Evil representing selfish maliciousness, and Neutral representing the balance of the two.

In combat, the amount of experience you receive from the vanquishing of a foe depends entirely on your alignment versus that of the creature you have killed.  In general, if you are Good and you kill a Good creature, or Evil and kill an Evil creature, or Neutral and kill a Neutral creature, you receive NO experience.  The amount of experience can vary depending upon how close to perfect Goodness, perfect Evil, or pure Neutrality you are.  In addition to receiving no experience for violating this rule, you will find your characters alignment slowly changing with each repeat offense.

For some classes, alignment can have other affects.  Paladins must always be good, and will find that their spellcasting ability disappears with their goodness.  Clerics may be good or evil, but their spell choices can profoundly impact their alignment.  A Good Cleric or Paladin who casts malicious spells will soon find themselves becoming evil.  Evil Clerics can suffer the same fate for using benevolent spells.
