# * NOTE! If you use && or || conjunctions, the same item may be found multiple times!
# [MASK] is the zapper mask for which players in which conditions require this component.
#     Note that only ONE trigger component is permitted per mob/player per skill requirement, 
#     so this mask might be important in ensuring that can't happens for skill requirements 
#     that have multiple TRIGGER type components in them.
#     See the help entry for ZAPPERMASKS for more information on creating zapper masks.
# [RITUAL] is a triggering ritual. (see AHELP RITUALS or Archon Guide under StdDeity "Cleric Ritual")
