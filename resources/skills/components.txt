# Format is as follows:
#    Spell/Skill ID=[PARAMETERS LIST]
# [PARAMETERS LIST] are as follows:
#    Spell_Sleep=([COMPONENT PARAMETER])&&([COMPONENT PARAMETER])||([COMPONENT PARAMETER])&&..etc..
#    May also end with a "description of the component requirement", in quotes, instead of &&/||
# [COMPONENT PARAMETER] are as follows:
#    ([DISPOSITION]:[FATE]:[AMOUNT]:[COMPONENT ID]:[MASK])
#  	 - OR -
#    (TRIGGER:[RITUAL]:[MASK])
# [DISPOSITION] is either: inventory, have, held, worn, nearby, onground (default inventory)
# [FATE] is either: consumed, kept (default consumed)
# [AMOUNT] is the number of amount of the component required (default 1)
# [COMPONENT ID] is one of the following:
#   a material name for a raw resource (like cloth, metal, mithril, leather, liquid, etc..)
#   a resource name for a raw resource (like cotton, iron, spidersteel, leather, oil, etc..)
#   a material or resource of a subtype in parenthesis like cotton(bolt)
#   an item name for a string match (like "a long crooked stick" or "stick" or "crooked"
# * NOTE! If you use && or || conjunctions, the same item may be found multiple times!
# [MASK] is the zapper mask for which players in which conditions require this component.
#     Note that only ONE trigger component is permitted per mob/player per skill requirement, 
#     so this mask might be important in ensuring that can't happens for skill requirements 
#     that have multiple TRIGGER type components in them.
#     See the help entry for ZAPPERMASKS for more information on creating zapper masks.
# [RITUAL] is a triggering ritual. (see AHELP RITUALS or Archon Guide under StdDeity "Cleric Ritual")
# ** You can also include component-only socials in this file.  See socials.txt for line format.
# Examples:
# WOODCHOPPING=(held:kept:1:*axe*:)
#   (the above requires an item with the characters "axe" in the name to do woodchopping)
# SPELL_SLEEP=(held:consumed:1:cotton:-CLASS +MAGE) || (inventory:consumed:10:sand:-CLASS +MAGE)
#   (the above requires either cotton in hand, or 10 sand in inventory to cast sleep -- applies only to mages)
