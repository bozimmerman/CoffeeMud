# This file is for defining a default set of skills that are available to all
# character classes, and each character class.  A skill available to ALL classes 
# does not belong to any particular class, but falls into a pool of skills that is
# subject to certain pooling rules, such as MAXCOMMONSKILLS and MAXLANGUAGES from 
# the coffeemud.ini file.  A skill available to EACH class belongs specifically to 
# each and every class individually, and is not subject to pool-related rules.
#
# The entries under the [EACH] and [ALL] sections are formatted as follows:
# [QUAL_LVL] [ABIL_ID] (AUTOGAIN) (PROF=[AMT]) (REQUIRES=[ABIL_ID]...) (MASK=[ZAPPERMASK])
# AUTOGAIN, PROF=, REQUIRES= and MASK= sections are optional. The REQUIRES section is a space 
# delimited list of Ability IDs of skills requires to learn the skill in question.  The ID
# may optionally be followed by a number in parenthesis, e.g. Skill_Write(75) to 
# require a certain proficiency to learn the skill.  MASK= is a zapper mask denoting
# what sort of person/mob qualifies for the skill.  See AHELP ZAPPERMASK for more info.
# The AUTOGAIN tag, if found, denotes that the skill is automatically gained when the
# level is reached.  The PROF= tag can be used to set a default proficiency.
