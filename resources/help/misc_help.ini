MULTICLASS=\
Each class was designed to reach it's peak of gainable skills at level 30. \
Changing to another class is done by going to your respective guild and \
training in the class of your choice. The classes you can become are listed \
when you type QUALIFY.  Changing to another class is done using the TRAIN \
command.\n\r\
\n\r\
When multiclassing, always keep in mind the classes you want to become \
and how far you would want to go in them. Some classes affect others in \
a negative way. If you plan to get to level 30 with three subclasses, \
train in the first before your first level of the game. This ensures \
level 30 status with all the classes. \n\r\
\n\r\
Just keep track of how far you feel like taking each class, whether it \
is to a certain skill or to it's full potential. It is not required, \
but can add a dimension to playing.

RAISE_ANCHOR=SAILING
SAILING=\
The captains of their own large multi-room sea vessels have many commands at their disposal for sailing the ship.\n\r\
\n\r\
The first thing to know is that, whenever you are on the deck of your ship, you can see what is \
in the waters or port around the ship almost as easily as you can see the deck itself.  To do this, \
you can either use the EXAMINE or LONGLOOK command to see both the deck and surrounding space, or LOOK \
directly at one of the exits from the ship.  If there are other ships in the same place as yours, you \
can also look directly at the other ship.\n\r\
\n\r\
When your ship is at port, you will want to have the ANCHOR lowered so that it can not move around. \
To do this, use the LOWER ANCHOR command.  When you want to get underway again, you'll have to \
RAISE ANCHOR.  You can lower and raise the anchor as often as you like in order to keep your ship in \
place or in motion.\n\r\
\n\r\
Friendly ships at sea may want want to exchange cargo or visit each other, and this is done by using \
the TENDER command.  By entering TENDER [OTHER SHIP NAME], your ship will offer to connect the ships \
via their gangplanks.  If the captain of the other ship likewise enters the TENDER command, then crews \
will be able to move freely between the ships using the gangplank.  Sailing away or combat will disconnect \
them.  If the friendly is a little boat, then the boat can TENDER [YOUR SHIP NAME], allowing you to RAISE \
[BOAT NAME] in order to get the little boat and its cargo onto your deck.  Small boats can be likewise \
lowered back to sea by using LOWER [BOAT NAME].\n\r\
\n\r\
To move a sailing ship, the simplest way is to enter SAIL [DIRECTION].  If the anchor is up, and the \
direction is one in which there is water, the ship will move in that direction.  For example, \
SAIL WEST will sail the ship west. \n\r\
\n\r\
Your ship can also move under-sail without constant direction using either the STEER or COURSE command. \
To make your ship move constantly in the same direction, use STEER [DIRECTION] command.  So long as the \
anchor remains up, and there remains more sea to travel, the ship will continue in that direction.  If your \
directions are more complex, you can use the COURSE [DIRECTION] [DIRECTION] ... command to give the ship \
a series of directions to follow without supervision.\n\r\
\n\r\
See also help on SHIP_COMBAT

AIM=In combat, you do not normally need to aim.  Your weapon will automatically attack the target of your kill \
command or your current enemy.  In ship tactical combat, however, the AIM command must be used to aim a specified \
siege weapon at some distance ahead of an enemy ship.  See help on SHIP_COMBAT for more information on ship tactical combat.

SHIP_COMBAT=\
Ship combat can be entered into by two or more ships whose captains are in PVP, two clans at war, or where \
one of the ships is driven by mobs.\n\r\
\n\r\
To enter into combat, one captain need only use the command TARGET [other ship name] to put both ships into \
tactical combat mode.  In tactical combat mode, a ship can no longer simply sail away to the next room, but \
must navigate the local ocean room whose dimensions reflect the size of the body of water.  The TARGET command \
can be used again and again to change the targets of all weapons or to get tactical information about another ship. \
Once in tactical mode, the only way to get out of it is to get away from enemy ships by putting as much space between \
your ship and their ship as there is space in the room, while sailing towards another ocean room.\n\r\
\n\r\
Sailing in tactical mode is very similar to normal sailing, except that ship tactical actions are only taken every \
8-12 seconds, called tactical rounds, instead of the usual 4-second ticks.  You can RAISE and LOWER your ANCHOR to \
prevent movement. You can use STEER to change which way your ship is facing, or SAIL to move your ship one space \
in the direction that your ship is facing.  The COURSE command is most important for tactical mode, however, as it is \
the only command that will allow you to move and change direction, depending on the speed of your ship.  In tactical mode, \
the last direction given to the COURSE command may be a direction change, while all prior directions must be the same as \
the ship is presently facing.  For example, if your ship is facing north, and your ship has a speed of 3, you may enter \
"COURSE north north east" to move your ship two north and turn east.\n\r\
\n\r\
To attack in tactical mode, you must first build appropriate siege weapons onto the deck of your ship.  Then, you need to \
issue the TARGET command at least once to specify which ship your weapons will be aimed at.  Each tactical round, you must \
then also use the LOAD command to load your weapons with ammunition, and the AIM command to aim each siege weapon.  The AIM \
command requires you to enter a number which corresponds to how many times you believe your target ship will move in their \
current facing direction.  If you don't believe the ship will move at all, you may use 0 as a value.  At the end of each tactical \
round, all sailing instructions are executed, and all weapons that are both loaded and aimed will fire at the target ship. \
A ship that receives damage will begin to lose speed as it takes more damage.  A ship that takes complete damage will sink. \n\r\
\n\r\
Once at sea, a ship can only be boarded by flying to it, through the use of grapples from another ship, or by climbing from \
a smaller rowboat type vessel.\n\r\
\n\r\
See also help on SAILING for more information about normal non-tactical sailing. 

LEVELS=Levels are things you gain when you get enough experience to gain them.  When you gain \
a level, you'll get more hit points, mana, movement, attack ability, and access to more skills, \
spells, prayers, chants, or songs.
CORPSE=A corpse is what you leave behind when you die.  It is a dead body.  If you LOOK at a corpse, \
you might see that it has equipment on it.  You can GET that equipment and use it yourself, sometimes.

CONQUER=CONQUEST

CONQUEST=\
One or more areas in the realm may be designated as conquerable by clans. \n\r\
\n\r\
To conquer an area, or even to discover if an area CAN be conquered, the \
clan must use the Clan Crafting skill to construct a clan Flag.  The Flag must \
then be dropped into any room in the area.  Doing so will tell you if the \
area is conquerable, who controls it if anyone, how many CONTROL POINTS \
are required to control the area, and how many control points any warring \
clans may presently have in the area.  An area not currently controlled by \
any clan may freely be conquered.  An area already controlled by a clan may \
only be conquered by a rival clan if that clan has properly declared War.\n\r\
\n\r\
The clan Flag is the most important item in Conquest.  The Flag must be on \
the ground in order for any clan to score control points in an area, or to \
even maintain control once the area has been conquered.  If there is not at \
least one Flag on the ground, a conquered area will revert to neutral status.  \
Luckily, any resident citizens in the same room as a conquerer's flag will tend to guard \
the flag from thieves.  Also, Flags can only be removed by a member of the \
clan whose flag it is, or by a rival clan after they have completely conquered \
and control the area.\n\r\
\n\r\
Once a flag has been laid down, the clan whose flag it is may LOOK at the flag \
at any time to see the status of their conquest; i.e. the number of control points \
they have scored, and how many they must score to complete the conquest.  A \
control point is scored whenever a resident intelligent mob of that area is killed, \
forced (via charm or other methods) to follow a member of the conquering clan, \
or (in the case of a Theocracy) converted to the faith. \
Control points awarded are equal to the level of the intelligent mob killed, charmed, or converted. \
Control points will also fade over time, to reflect a restoration of order in the \
area.\n\r\
\n\r\
If an area is already under the control of a clan, the resident mobs will \
resist invasion by rivals.  Once an area is conquered, however, all resident \
mobs will instantly repudiate any previous controlling clan, drop any clan items \
they may be carrying, and swear allegiance to the conquering clan.  At this \
point, any clan members who are designated as having conquerers privileges may \
ORDER any non-animal member of the area to do anything they like.  Control points become \
irrelevant to the conquerers once conquest is complete.  A number of days following \
the conquest of an area, the area will be in dispute as order is restored.  During \
this period, no items left by vanquished clans can be retrieved.  Once control is \
completely established, however, the controlling clan may clear out the previous \
clans items for experience. \n\r\
\n\r\
Clan members are unable to gain any experience points inside their \
own conquered areas.  However, anyone else gaining experience in a clan \
controlled area automatically pays the clans tax on their experience gain. \
This makes controlling a large number of areas very lucrative for clans.\n\r\
\n\r\
A conquered area benefits greatly from items created using Clan Crafting.  These \
items can be crafted by a designated Enchanter, given sufficient materials \
and clan experience.  Aside from the direct benefit of putting the residents of \
a conquered area to work, clan crafted items in the hands of a conquered areas \
residents also makes those residents happy.  Keeping such items in the hands of \
a sufficient number of especially higher level mobs will stave off spontaneous \
revolts, which become possible from time to time in a conquered area. \
During war, clan items can be captured for additional clan experience \
by rival clans who have properly declared war. The types and functions \
of clan items include:\n\r\
\n\r\
Book of the Laws - These must be constructed inside the area for which the book is \
intended.  It will allow a properly privileged clan member to read and modify \
numerous aspects of law and order in the area, including the location of jails, \
the types of laws, and the duration of punishments. A Law Book must be read by \
clan member authorized to change law before the Guardbanner and Gavel below will \
begin working.\n\r\
\n\r\
Guardbanner - These can be given to mobs in a conquered area to designate them \
as deputys of the area, who are authorized to enforce laws and arrest lawbreakers.\n\r\
\n\r\
Judges Gavel - This can be given to a mob in a conquered area to designate him \
as the judge of the area, authorizing him to deal out punishments like parole, \
jail time, or death.\n\r\
\n\r\
Donation List - This item should be placed inside the official Donation Room for \
a clan.  If this is done, the list will automatically grow to include every \
single addition and removal.\n\r\
\n\r\
Pamphlet - These can be given to mobs conquered by RIVAL clans to make them \
disloyal to the conquering clan. Pamphlets will have a tendency to spread over time. \
Pamphlet holders will also drop any rival clan items they have, which hurts control.\n\r\
\n\r\
Shop Apron - These can be given to mobs conquered by your clan, or to mobs permanently \
stationed at your clan home.  They turn the mob into a shopkeeper, who will sell things \
in their shop inventory, and buy things as their coinage allows.  They can be GIVEN \
things to sell by clan members in proper authority over them.  They will not deal with \
clans with whom your clan is hostile or at war.\n\r\
\n\r\
Membership Card - These can be given to mobs conquered by your clan to make them utterly \
loyal to your clan.  Mobs with membership cards will never accept Pamphlets, and will take \
them away if they are offered any.\n\r\
\n\r\
Gathering items - Items such as the Miners Pick and Lumberjacks Saw can be given \
to mobs to make them work for the clan, performing the Common skill associated \
with the item.  If the mobs with these items are also Mobile, they may also \
carry their resources to other mobs in the same area who need their \
resources in order to use their Crafting items.  Firebuilders are especially \
good at this task, as they will carry wood they find to smiths and light the \
fires that the smiths need to shape the metals.\n\r\
\n\r\
Crafting items - Items such as the Tailors Needle and Potters Wheel can be given \
to mobs to make them craft items for the clan, performing the Common skill \
associated with the item.  These mobs can be given example items to use as \
templates for what they will attempt to make, or they can be given nothing to \
make them craft items at random.  For the skill to work, the mob must not have \
anything in its inventory to confuse the skill, such as a Blacksmith item \
holder carrying some smurfberries.  Also, the holder must have the correct resource \
and sufficient quantity in the room to work from, although, they may receive \
assistance gaining the resources they need from mobs with Gathering Items.\n\r\
\n\r\
Executioners Scales - This item makes the mob a tenacious attacker of evil \
creatures and thieves.\n\r\
\n\r\
Assassins Eye - This item makes the mob a tenacious attacker of good \
creatures and paladins.\n\r\
\n\r\
Scavengers Sticker - This item makes the mob a scavenger, picking anything up \
they find on the ground.\n\r\
\n\r\
Tax Collectors Clipboard - This item makes the mob a collector of tax money from \
anyone who is not also a member of their clan.\n\r\
\n\r\

RANGED_COMBAT=RANGE

RANGE=When combat is initiated, CoffeeMud will instantly determine the distance \
between the two combatants.  The initial distance will be based on the size of the \
room the players are in, and the maximum range of the weapon or spell used by the initiator \
of combat.  If either combatant is in a group, the initial distance of the group members \
from their combatant will be based on their formation (see FORMATION) if one was specified.\n\r\
\n\r\
During combat, if a combatant is out of range of their primary weapon, they will automatically \
advance towards their opponent until they are within the minimum range of their primary weapon. \
If a combatant has AUTOMELEE turned *off*, however, they will do the opposite -- they will not \
advance if they are out of range, but WILL spend actions retreating if they are \
too close to their opponent (outside the minimum range of their weapon).  AUTOMELEE should \
therefore be turned on for fighters who use melee weapons and need to make sure they constantly \
advance, and should be turned off for mages using ranged spells, or users of ranged weapons like bows.

BROKEN=If a limb should become broken for whatever reason, the path to healing begins with getting \
the bones set, using either the bandaging skills, or some sort of healing prayer.  This will enable \
the bone to begin healing on its own.  Some broken limbs are little more than an inconvenience, while \
others can cause serious problems with movement, or even with manipulating items.

TROPHY=TROPHIES

TROPHIES=Clans can earn one or more of the available trophies by controlling the \
most areas through conquest, controlling the most area control points through \
conquest, or my having the most experience points.  See HELP CONQUEST and HELP \
CLANS for more information.

CLANS=Clans are a group of players banded together for some common purpose, or due to \
common lineage or fellowship.  \
Clans are created using the CLANCREATE command, \
and listed using CLANLIST.  Once created, CLANPREMISE can be used to describe the \
clan.  Potential members apply to clans using CLANAPPLY, and are \
either accepted by the clan using CLANACCEPT or rejected using CLANREJECT, \
after listing the applicants names using CLANDETAILS. \
Bosses can set up autorejecting qualifications to the clan using CLANQUAL. \
Once accepted, members can be removed using CLANEXILE or promoted to other \
offices using CLANASSIGN.  Members can leave on their own using CLANRESIGN. \
Offices like Treasurers can deal with \
special Clan bankers and postmen on their Clans behalf.  Members can \
cast "Clan Donate" to their clans after the boss has used CLANDONATESET to set a \
donation room for their clan.  Members can share their experience points \
with the clan if the bosses have set up an experience tax rate using CLANTAX. \
Members also have access to the spell "Clan Home" \
which they can use to recall to the room set by the boss using CLANHOMESET. \
Clan activity is very important.  If the minimum number of members is not \
maintained, then pending or inactive clans may be deleted by the system. \
Once there are several active clans, the bosses may use CLANDECLARE to \
declare relations between their clan and others, and members can use CLANKILLS \
or CLANPVPKILLS to keep track of how their members fair in war.\n\r\
\n\r\
There are many different types of clans: GANG, GUILD, UNION, FELLOWSHIP, THEOCRACY, \
ANARCHY, and FAMILY.  See the HELP entry for each of these clan types for more information.

TIME=\
Time in CoffeeMud is divided into 6 "hours", each of which is about \
10 real minutes long.  Hours in CoffeeMud are numbered from 0-5. \
Dawn is at hour 0, dusk is at hour 4, and night at hour 5. \
There are 20 mud "days" to each month, and 8 mud "months" to each year. \
The months are divided into four seasons.

CLASS=Try HELP FIGHTER, THIEF, BARD, CLERIC, MAGE, APPRENTICE, or DRUID. For help \
on multi-classing, try HELP MULTICLASS.
CLASSES=CLASS

ARTISAN=<CHARCLASS>\
An Artisan is a professional tradesman who specializes in the common skills \
that make civilization work.  Although his fighting weakness makes him a poor \
choice for exploring those monster filled dungeons, the Artisan is still able \
to advance by using his skills and gaining experience while he does! Artisans, \
like Apprentices, may still choose to go into a more adventurous profession, \
but like Apprentices, they are unable to go back.

SAILOR=<CHARCLASS>\
Sailors are the workmen of the high seas.  These common folk spend their lives \
gathering resources, traveling, transporting goods, and exploring seas, rivers, \
and lakes.  On large sailing vessels, their skills are unparalleled, and no \
ship should be without plenty of them.

GAOLER=<CHARCLASS>\
The Gaoler (pronounced like Jailer), is the ancient dungeon keeper.  He \
specializes in those implements and activities which reflect the worst and \
most sadistic side of human nature.  Although not much use as an adventurer, \
a player with a Gaoler background can be a valuable member of a clan, or a \
man-for-hire. 

APPRENTICE=<CHARCLASS>\
An Apprentice may not go past level 1, and qualifies only for the games most \
common non-combat skills.  You are free to move around in the game like anyone \
else, in order to learn some of the ropes before choosing a more \
permanent career.  When you have decided which of the main classes to go \
to, you may use the TRAIN command with an appropriate teacher to become \
the class of your choosing.  If you can't find an appropriate teacher, \
remember that a player of the proper class may be able to help you.  \
Be sure to save yourself a training point for this purpose!

FIGHTER=<CHARCLASS>\
Fighters are brutish weapon masters, skilled in the art of killing.  They may \
specialize in any weapon type, and learn numerous new fighting techniques as \
they advance in level.  Fighters receive more hit points and attack bonuses \
per level than any other class, and are invaluable in a close melee.\
\n\r\n\r\
Fighter is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Monk, Ranger, Paladin, and Barbarian.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The fighters strength is in his domination of pure combat. \
When playing alone, a fighter is fully capable of gaining the necessary \
experience.  However, the fighter may choose to lead a group to gain an \
even greater advantage.  As the tank (primary melee combatant) in a group, \
the fighter will give the group the benefit of his superior armor and fighting \
skill, while benefitting from the healing spells of a cleric, or the magical \
aids of a mage.\
\n\r\n\r\
The fighters greatest weakness is his inability to move secretly, or get into \
or out of tricky spots.  For this reason, the fighter outside of a group \
should steer towards simple combat areas, and be content only with the \
treasures obtains from his kills.\n\r

SCHOLAR=<CHARCLASS>\
Scholars are the researchers, teachers, librarians, curators, students and \
other academians that protect the knowledge of advanced civilizations and \
pass down the wisdom from previous generations. They excel at educating, \
organizing, cataloging, and categorizing.  Fighting? Not so much.

THIEF=<CHARCLASS>\
Thieves are skillful, sly, and devious. They may only use daggers \
and swords, and may only wear leather armor at best.  However, they come \
with numerous skills allowing them to survive in the dog-eat-dog world, \
including swiping and stealing; hiding, peeking, and sneaking; trapping, \
poisoning, and many others.  Thieves also qualify for many devious fighting abilities.\
\n\r\n\r\
Thief is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Assassin, Arcanist (Arcane Rogue), Burglar, and Trapper.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The thieves strength is in his ability to obtain money, and in his \
ability to navigate tricky situations.  By accumulating the wealth of others, \
the thief can stay comfortably equipped with the latest and best money can buy. \
When playing alone, the thief thrives as the only class able to get into and \
out of any secret place without stirring up unnecessary trouble.  Although \
not generally appreciated in groups, a group benefits from these skills, as \
well as the thiefs unique ability to deliver enormous amounts of backstab \
damage.\
\n\r\n\r\
The thief is only moderately skilled at combat, but can make up for it by \
using his wealth to obtain favors, good equipment, and the necessary potions \
and scrolls necessary to survive the experience gaining battles.\n\r

DRUID=<CHARCLASS>\
Druids are mystical guardians of the natural world, and the wielders \
of natures grandest powers.  They may not wear metal, and can only use a \
small set of natural weapons, but their notorious health and magical chants \
more than make up for this.  Like the natural world, Druids are restricted \
to a neutral alignment.\
\n\r\n\r\
Druid is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Delver, Beastmaster, Gaian, Mer, and SkyWatcher.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The druid is the most complex class to play.  Most of his magic \
requires the assistance of numerous spells to bear fruit, but the benefits make \
the complexity well worth it.  The druid is also best fit for travelling with \
animal armies of his own creation.  In groups, the druid can assist with some \
extra fire power at high levels.  For the most part though, it is alone that \
the druid will flourish, forming his own animal groups to make up for his \
weakness in combat.\
\n\r\n\r\
Although weak in melee combat, due to equipment and skill limitations, the druid \
is capable of marshaling all the powers of animals and plants to aid in the vanquishing \
of foes for experience.  At higher levels, as the powers of weather come into play, \
the Druid will find their magical prowess unequaled by any other class.

BEASTMASTER=<CHARCLASS>\
Like Tarzan or Grizzly Adams, the BeastMaster is the lord of his particular \
jungle, being both the guardian and master steward of the animal kingdom. \
Unlike the other druids then, the beastmaster takes great pride in his \
animal changing abilities, and receives many more animal forms as he \
progresses in level.  The beastmaster is also more accutely aware of the \
dangers of the wild, and is thus a much more physical and able fighter \
than other druids tend to be.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Beastmaster is the perfect loner druid class, though he \
is never truly alone with all the animals he can summon to his side. He \
also has numerous ways of enhancing his own innate fighting ability through \
magical chants, making him formidable even when adventuring without animal \
companions.

GAIAN=<CHARCLASS>\
The Gaian is the druid of the green earth, watching over the plants, trees \
and all growing things.  The gaian has a very special relationship with the \
plants and trees, having special abilities to make almost any location \
he steps into a sanctuary for his leafed friends.  So in tune with green \
things is the gaian that sunlight can actually give his green tinted skin \
additional powers, though the darkness will slightly weaken his chanting stamina.  \
The gaian can also call on the plants and trees around \
him to aid in him combat, to hide him from foes, or even to provide him with \
the things one would normally have to seek civilization for.  \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Gaian, so long as he stays around green plants, is a formidable foe to all \
enemies of nature.  The gaian can call all aspects of the plants to his aid, \
and can always find sanctuary in the green plants during times of trouble.  The \
gaian is weak in native combat abilities, like the other druids, but can make \
up for it with creative pre-casting, and good use of the power of nature during \
combat.

SKYWATCHER=<CHARCLASS>\
The SkyWatcher is the master druid of the stars and heavens, being the \
very powerful steward of the great wheel in the sky.  The SkyWatcher \
maintains a special connection with the moon, and gains numerous special \
abilities to summon great powers from luna.  So connected is he to the \
moon that his strength and powers will fluxuate during the month, following \
the phase of the moon.  A master of wind and weather, the SkyWatcher is also \
very capable of bringing the heavens down upon his enemies at need. \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: More even than the other druids, the SkyWatcher must concern himself \
with pre-casting. That is to say, the SkyWatcher must be aware of his environment \
at all times in terms of weather, time, temperature, and locale, and must be \
fully prepared to alter these conditions to make them favorable to the chants \
he means to use against his enemies in combat.  All SkyWatchers must also realize \
that their effectiveness when not outdoors will be almost nil, as practically every \
chant requires the use of outside conditions and resources.

MER=<CHARCLASS>\
The Mer Druid is an aquatic nature lover who has mastered the ability to live and \
dwell with sea creatures.  The Mer Druid is most suited for aquatic areas, and \
excels at water and ship combat, using the forces of the ocean with an amazing \
display of power and destruction.  So connected is he to the \
tides that his strength and powers will fluxuate during the day, ebbing and rising \
with the high and low tide.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Like a fish, the Mer Druid is nearly useless out of the water.  But \
when either above or beneath the waves, the Mer is an unstoppable force.  Grouping \
with others on land and taking charge of the situation when the waves roll in \
is the way for a Mer Druid to flourish.

PIRATE=<CHARCLASS>\
The Pirate is a rogue and scourge of the high seas, a master of ship combat, and \
ruthless to those who refuse to surrender their booty. The Pirate is most suited for \
combat from the deck of huge sailing ships, being able to get the most out of \
their ship, their weapons, and their landlubber contacts.  Their brutal lifestyle \
even gives them combat bonuses with fake limbs.  However, Pirates also get harsher \
treatment from the law, and are so greedy for gold that they can literally be paid \
to walk away from combat.\n\r\
\n\r\
How to play: The Pirate is a middlin' fair rogue on the land, and can survive well \
enough among landlubbers, but absolutely excels in command of a ship in pursuit of \
weak seabound targets.  Clans would do well to keep a former-independent Pirate \
around to captain their ships for when the real ones come calling.

DELVER=<CHARCLASS>\
The Delver is a stolid druid of caves and the underdark, being the guardian of \
the rocks and stone and the cold caverns of the deep.  The Delver is unconcerned \
with plants or the sky or the doings of the weather, or any of the creatures that \
live upon it, relying rather on the solid earth to draw his power from.  For this \
reason, the Delver is particularly at home among the rocks, and is able to call \
upon them to aid him at need. \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Delver requires little in the way of precasting or planning, so \
long as he stays in cave or rocky environments.  He is able to instantly call upon \
the rocks and stones to help him in combat, and is friend to golems and stone \
creatures.  For this reason, the Delver is better able to fit into groups who \
wish to adventure in the mountains and the underground, and can be a valuable \
leader when its time to enter the deep dark.

BARD=<CHARCLASS>\
Bards are traveling singers, whose "songs" can possess powerful magic.  \
They are highly desired group members for the inspiration they bring to \
their team members, and the great stings they provide to their enemies.  \
They possess the same weapon and armor restrictions as thieves, but \
also qualify for many thief skills.\
\n\r\n\r\
Bard is the basis for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include \
the Charlatan, Dancer, Minstrel, and the Jester.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The great strength of the bard is in his wide assortment of \
skills, and in his powerful songs.  The bard may try his hand as the lonesome \
traveler, but will find his skills still put him behind his peers.  It is \
in the company of other, more powerful classes, that the bard will flourish. \
And because of the unique nature of his magic, and how his skills will always \
affect groups, that groups will always want to have a bard along.\
\n\r\n\r\
Bards are as weak as thieves in combat, and lack their general sneakiness, \
so in the company of others must the bard find his path to greatness, \
filling any skill gaps in almost any group with the appropriate magic or \
ability.\n\r

CHARLATAN=<CHARCLASS>\
The Charlatan is the master of deception and disguise.  Often praised  \
because of his natural acting ability, as well as his highly social \
nature, the Charlatan can be quite antisocial if he chooses, and extremely \
annoying to other players almost without trying.  \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Charlatan is also a natural spy in muds with numerous \
players, and has an extremely wide assortment of skills.  More than any \
other class, the Charlatan can taste the powers of all other classes, \
sometimes with real skill, and sometimes only in seeming.  For this reason, \
the Charlatan is ideal for those who want a taste of all classes, or at least \
to seem like he is.  He is a natural group member, being able to fit almost \
any role by using his varied skills, or by tricking his group members into \
thinking he belongs in the role they require.

MINSTREL=<CHARCLASS>\
The Minstrel is the master of instruments and musical tools.  So capable is \
a minstrel in this art that he or she is able to draw forth magical and \
wonderous powers from the instruments played.  The Minstrel is able to \
craft and draw unique powers from any of dozens of different musical \
instruments, with the only drawback being how the chosen instrument \
impacts fighting or speaking ability while it is being played.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Minstrel is as social of a bard as the others, but due to \
his many hours of lonely practice, the Minstrel also has an almost arcane \
like ability to use instrumental magic for more solitary or unique benefits \
than the simple Bard or Dancer.  In the end, the Minstrel may become an orchestra \
of power unto himself, capable of bringing tremendous benefit and joy to his \
group, or terrible retribution to his foes.  Therefore, if a player is looking \
for a bard to play when groups are not available, this is the one to pick.

DANCER=<CHARCLASS>\
The Dancer is the graceful master of dance, who entertains and leads others \
in the joyous and powerful maneuvers of his craft.  Like the Bard, the Dancer \
is a highly desired group member for his "group affecting" skills, which include \
the magical dances in which he specializes.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Due to his weak fighting skill, the Dancer will likely look to \
groups for his primary advancement, much like the other bards.  Dancers \
also gain a select set of powerful fighter skills to prove the worth of their \
diligence in maintaining his body.  This makes them valuable group members, even \
without their powerfully enhancing dances.

JESTER=<CHARCLASS>\
The Jester is the joking, annoying, and sneaky fellow that few Bards like to \
claim.  Like the Charlatan, they remain associated with Bards due to their \
highly social nature and their charismatic attitudes.  The Jester is also \
amazingly dextrous and slippery, due to the slapstick style of maneuvers \
he practices and specializes in.  \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: As the levels progress, however, few could argue the seriousness of the \
Jesters power, should his goofy smile, for some reason, be turned around. \
The Jester is still, clearly, a group player.  He needs the strong tanking of \
fighters, and other support classes to flourish, though he can still hold his \
own if he manages not to take life too seriously.

CLERIC=<CHARCLASS>\
Clerics are the great vassals of the Gods.  Through \
them the wonders of both good and evil are possible.  Clerics possess \
great magical abilities in their numerous "prayers".  While their weapon \
choices are limited to their alignment, they may wear any type of armor.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Cleric is the general of priests, appeasing all the gods equally, \
or choosing to focus on one at his whim.  However, should the cleric \
wish to show true devotion, he can gain levels in specialist classes \
which may or may not be available to him, depending on his disposition. \
These classes include: Templar, Shaman, Doomsayer, Necromancer, \
Missionary, Purist, Healer, or Oracle.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The first, last, and greatest strength of the good Cleric is in \
his ability to heal, just as the ability to harm aids the evil Cleric.  A Cleric \
is unique in his ability to flourish either alone or in groups, being moderately \
skilled in combat, and having the healing ability to last a long time in a \
tough fight.  Clerics are highly desired for groups, however, as the lead \
fighter in the group will want the Cleric's healing touch in battle.\
\n\r\n\r\
The only weakness of the Cleric is offensively, which the evil Cleric will \
make up for with harmful magic, and the good Cleric will compensate for with \
healing spells to last out the battle.  With a balanced approach, the Cleric \
can gain experience with the efficiency of a fighter.\n\r

MAGE=<CHARCLASS>\
Mages are masters of magic, and wielders of the great elemental powers.  \
While weak in hit points and in fighting skill, their spells are the most \
widely prized and powerful of all the classes.  They may not wear any metal \
or leather armors, or use most weapons.  However, the sting of their magic \
missiles and the armor of magic they wear makes up for any loss.\
\n\r\n\r\
Mage is the basis for numerous sub-classes which the player \
may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: \
Abjurer, Alterer, Conjurer, Diviner, Enchanter, Evoker, Illusionist, \
Transmuter, and Wizard.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Mages are among the most versatile of classes, being able to make \
spell choices which carve out the path the Mage would like to take.  For the \
loner Mage, the emphasis on offensive magic will make him a powerful opponent in \
battle.  In groups, the mage may focus on protective magic to make him a more \
desirable companion.  And even the playful mage may focus on the role-playing \
magic to make his mudding as fun as possible!\
\n\r\n\r\
The mage is almost useless in weapon combat.  The mage must be smart and \
creative to use his spells to give him the edge.  But the versatility of the \
mage gives him the ability to do just that, using magic and guile to trick \
monsters to their death, granting experience for the mage.\n\r

WIZARD=<CHARCLASS>\
Wizards are great specialist scholar mages who have mastered the study (but not the art) \
of arcane magic.  They are capable of memorizing and casting any basic arcane spell, \
but their lack of mastery means they forget the spell as soon as it \
is cast.  This means that the wizard is constantly engaged in study, carrying around and/or \
creating numerous arcane scrolls to serve as the source for their next bit of magic.  Since \
they don't specialize or train in particular arcane spells, but can learn any spell, the \
Wizard is the most versatile Mage, though not necessarily the easiest to engage in combat with. \
\n\r\n\r\
The Wizards manner of study requires that he expend his spell-casting mana when he learns \
or memorizes a spell, but this mana is released for use after the spell is cast.  Wizards \
can be invaluable as group members, and as clan members, but will struggle adventuring alone. \
A wizards lack of need to expend training time on individual spells means he can work on other \
aspects of himself, including stats or expertises, making the Wizard very powerful in the long run.

PALADIN=<CHARCLASS>\
Paladins are holy fighters, possessing many of the traits of both Fighters \
and Clerics, though in less intensity than either class alone.  They may \
learn Cleric spells at higher levels, and possess numerous fighting techniques.  \
Their weapons and armor choices are unlimited, but Paladins are restricted \
to a good alignment.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Paladin's have the potential of being the most powerful of classes, \
and the most desired of group members.  Their powerful combat skills and auras \
of power make them the perfect tanks for groups, especially since their Cleric \
healing abilities can allow them to fill this gap in a group.  Alone, they can \
also flourish, vanquishing evil with the efficiency of the fighter.\
\n\r\n\r\
The only weakness of the Paladin is his reliance on goodness.  In most muds, \
this limits his adventuring choices greatly.  However, his strengths for \
lasting and winning in combat are so broad, he will quickly advance.\n\r

RANGER=<CHARCLASS>\
Rangers are noted primarily for their ability to track their friends and \
enemies, though their knowledge of the natural world has also given them \
great magical strength.  They are a cross between the fighter and the druid, \
gaining druid chants at higher levels, and numerous fighting techniques.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Rangers can provide a unique opportunity for experience advancement \
in a mud.  Their combat skills make them desirable as group members as tanks. \
Their ability to use scrolls gives them access to magic that grants them some \
of the mages versatility.  Meanwhile, the druidic chants they learn gives them \
a unique affinity with animals, allowing them to form their own groups as well.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Ranger, like the Paladin, is not quite as strong a fighter as a pure \
fighter, but makes up for this using his magical animal affinity.  Also, the \
Ranger will have to be careful to maintain a neutral alignment in order for \
the druidic chants to become useful.  In the meantime, the ranger must use \
scrolls and other magical items to supplement his natural fighting skill.\n\r

BARBARIAN=<CHARCLASS>\
Barbarians are the wild warriors of the frontier.  Their ability to deal \
large amounts of damage in combat, as well as inspire combative behaviors \
in others makes them especially ferocious.  They are fond of mastering \
numerous weapons, and building up their bodies, though they distrust \
metal armors, and may not wear them without difficulties.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Barbarian combat skills make them desirable as group members. \
While their non-metal armor restriction can sometimes hurt their nomination \
as tanks, their ability to deal and absorb large amounts of damage can \
more than make up for anything lacked.  Because of this, the Barbarian \
flourishes as well alone as in groups.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Barbarian is every bit as strong a fighter as a pure Fighter, and has \
that extra combative edge that many players look for in a Class.  Players \
who dislike subtelty and enjoy straight up hack-and-slash playing will \
enjoy the Barbarian's simple destructive style.\n\r

ABJURER=<CHARCLASS>\
Abjurers are specialist mages who concentrate their studies towards the \
mastery of protective magic.  So adept have they become that they \
automatically gain every known abjuration spell when they gain levels, \
including spells which only the abjurer may master. \
\n\r\n\r\
Although the Abjurer will not have the benefit of Enchantment spells, \
they are still formidible foes.  Their protective magic lasts much \
longer than that of other mages, and they still have access to many \
of the most dangerous spells.\n\r

ALTERER=<CHARCLASS>\
Alterers are specialist mages who concentrate their studies in the \
mastery of altering the world around them.  Their all-purpose skills \
serve them wonderfully in combat, in the maintenance of their own \
health and equipment, and in becoming successful adventurers.  So \
skilled are they in the alteration of the universe that they gain \
all known alteration spells, including some which only the alterer \
may gain.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Alterer suffers from a lack of access to the Evocation \
school of magic, the long duration and heavy impact of their \
spells plus the general usefulness of their school makes them a \
good choice for all mages.  Since they have their own kind of \
destructive magic, they will find they don't miss evocations at \
all.\n\r

CONJURER=<CHARCLASS>\
Conjurers are specialist mages who concentrate their studies in the \
mastery of movement.  They are adept at transporting themselves and \
other creatures, as well as items and entire armies with their \
powerful spells.  So adept are they at conjuration that they gain \
all known conjuration spells, including some which only the conjurers \
may understand.\
\n\r\n\r\
The Conjurer may lack Transmutation abilities, but he does not miss \
that strange magic.  After all, it's always better to be yourself, \
wherever you might find yourself.\n\r
 
DIVINER=<CHARCLASS>\
Diviners are specialist mages who have mastered the arts of unconvering \
secrets, and obtaining knowledge.  The entire world is an open book for \
them, just waiting for the pages to be turned.  So adept do these mages \
become at divination that they gain all known divination spells, \
including some which are even secrets to the other mages!\
\n\r\n\r\
The Diviner's love of knowledge means he loses the knack of casting \
spells of illusion.  However, they make up for this by being the most \
popular of advisors and group members when strange and amazing \
treasures are uncovered, or some secret needs to be told.\n\r

ENCHANTER=<CHARCLASS>\
Enchanters are specialist mages who can always seem to bring out the \
best magical aspects of whoever or whatever they turn their attention \
to.  And when angered, the Enchanter can also twist their enemies \
to their will.  So adept are they at this art of change that they \
gain all known enchantment spells, even those which only the enchanter \
may learn.\
\n\r\n\r\
Enchanters love change so much that they neglect the protective \
magic of abjuration, and find themselves unable to use that magic.  \
However, the Enchanter does not fear the snake's poison, or the \
dragon's breath, especially when he can snap his fingers and make \
them both his pets!\n\r

EVOKER=<CHARCLASS>\
Evokers are specialist mages who can bring from nothing the powers \
of light and darkness, heat and cold, lightning and ferocious wind.  \
So adept are these mages are the creation of these magical elements \
that they automatically gain all evocation/invocation spells, even \
those known only to evokers.\
\n\r\n\r\
Evokers are so impatient to create from nothing that they have neglected \
the study of the alteration of already existing things, and will find \
themselves unable to use alteration magic.  However, the Evoker is the horror \
of all specialist mages, death in both fingers, and is envied by all for \
his power.\n\r

ILLUSIONIST=<CHARCLASS>\
Illusionists are specialist mages who have mastered the art of deception \
and illusion.  They can make anyone believe anything, and can fool the \
senses into believing whatever they wish.  Illusionists are sly and \
playful, and so adept at their art that they gain all known illusion \
spells, even those known only to illusionists.\
\n\r\n\r\
So lost in their dreamworld is the Illusionist, that he forgets what \
is true, and finds himself unable to remember his divination spells.  \
However, the Illusionist is the greatest and most fun of the social \
mages, with a nice mix of defensive magic that can save him in times \
of need.\n\r

TRANSMUTER=<CHARCLASS>\
Transmuters are specialist mages who can transform the likeness and \
composition of anyone they touch.  Transmutation is the most feared \
of magics, and the Transmuter is so skilled at his art that he gains \
all known transmutation spells automatically, including the most \
secret and ugly of spells only the specialist may learn.\
\n\r\n\r\
Transmuters care nothing for conjuration, and so they soon neglect \
that kind of magic, being more fascinated with the many shapes of \
things right here at home.  Although the Evoker believes himself \
the king of specialists with his harmful beams, the Transmuter is \
the most feared and hated of specialists for the terrible \
and awesome consequences of his spells.\n\r

MONK=<CHARCLASS>\
Monks are the agile and graceful masters of their own bodies.  Combining quick \
reflexes with intense study of the martial arts makes them a powerful and \
intimidating opponent.  Although Monks may use weapons, most of their power \
and unique ability comes when they are completely unarmed.  And since they \
depend so heavily on their agility, they will find themselves wearing only \
light cloth armors.\
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Either alone or in groups, the Monk is a dizzying class to play. \
Capable of more pure attacks than any other class, and loaded down with \
dozens of Monk-specific physical feats makes the Monk almost mage-like \
in complexity.  In fact, the player who loathes worrying about staying \
up-to-date on equipment, but who enjoys the pure fight may be especially \
attracted to Monk.\
\n\r\n\r\
Like all fighters, the Monk will gain experience principally through the \
vanquishing of foes.  Although the armor restriction can seem daunting, the \
Monks extra dexterity bonus to armor, and the wide variety of attacks and \
defences makes them every bit as powerful (if not much more) than the other \
fighter classes.\n\r

DOOMSAYER=<CHARCLASS>\
Doomsayers are very special servants of the gods, whose proclaimations \
of fire and brimstone give them resistance to fire attacks, as well \
as special powers controlling it.  The Doomsayer is an evil aligned \
class, meaning that he will always fumble on good prayers, and does \
not qualify for good prayers.  However, the Doomsayer can use many \
dangerous edged weapons, any kind of armor, and gets numerous \
special prayers that only the doomsayer can claim. \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Doomsayer is easily the most wicked, cruel, and \
hated of all the Clerics.  He is also the most social of the evil \
clerics, being a clear rival to the Healer.  He is best played as a \
loner in cities, bringing the wrath of his God wherever he goes.

NECROMANCER=<CHARCLASS>\
Necromancers are the dark lovers of death and the dead, serving the gods \
in this special and little appreciated realm.  The Necromancer is an evil \
aligned class, meaning that he will always fumble on good prayers, and does \
not qualify for good prayers.  However, the Necromancer can use many \
dangerous edged weapons, any kind of armor, and gets numerous \
special prayers known only to the Necromancer, such as the ability to \
animate all kinds of wicked undead, even at low levels. Eventually, the \
Necromancer may even become a Lich himself! \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Unlike most clerics, the Necromancer is not a good group player. \
He does best alone with the friends he "makes" out of the dearly departed, so \
long as he is careful to keep them magically Fed and Healed long enough to gain useful levels. \
The necromancer is hated in towns, and may even be arrested if he brings \
his undead "friends" to town for a visit.  If the Necromancer keeps his \
charisma high, he can lead a truly formidable army before which all others \
will surely tremble.  

PURIST=<CHARCLASS>\
Purists are the idyllic representatives of the goodness of divinity.  They \
are so strict in their goodness that they seem to many cold and unyielding. \
This nature is so ingrained, in fact, that the purist gains many cold and \
cold-based attacks and defensive prayers.  This includes special powers \
over water and purity.  The Purist is a good aligned class, meaning that \
he always fumble evil prayers. \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Purist is a wonderfully social cleric, though only in the \
sense that he is often found with other people.  His strict unyielding prayers \
can sometimes get annoying glances from group members, though the Purist should \
remain resolute in his convictions that he is right.  Overall, the Purist is a \
good balanced cleric who can hold his own, as well as a valued group member (so \
long as he keeps his mouth shut).

MISSIONARY=<CHARCLASS>\
Missionaries are the crusading adventurers for the gods, exploring and \
spreading the good word of their deity far and wide.  So energetic and mobile \
are the Missionaries that they seem like the wind, and in fact gain many \
powers of wind and electricity.  The Missionary is a neutral aligned \
class. \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: Although Missionaries can flourish with other missionaries, \
they do their best work alone, bringing the word of their god, as well \
as his wrath when necessary, to the unwashed masses.  Missionaries will \
sometimes be asked to join groups so as to deliver some of that "olde-tyme \
neutral punch", and can even be useful to them if he strikes a careful \
balance with the good and evil prayers he qualifies for.

HEALER=<CHARCLASS>\
Healers project the most benevolent aspects of their gods by bringing \
life and good health to those around them.  The Healer is so adept at \
these arts that his or her healing prayers are more powerful than those \
cast by any other cleric.  The Healer is a good aligned class, meaning that \
he will always fumble on evil prayers, and does not qualify for evil \
prayers.  The Healer also gets a few special prayers known only to \
the Healer, including the great Aura of Healing at 30th level. \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: More than any other cleric, the Healer is a most desirable \
group member.  There is no ailment, no weakness, no problem almost that \
the Healer can not cure through the power of his god.  In the heat of battle, \
or in the periods in between, the Healer is a valued friend to those who take \
the brunt of battle.  The Healer can also try it alone if he likes, if he is \
willing to use patience and plenty of cure spells to outlast his opponents.

ORACLE=<CHARCLASS>\
Oracles are those who seek the infinite wisdom of their god, forever probing \
the vastness of divine knowledge.  So knowledgable are the Oracles that they \
actually begin to gain arcane divination spells in addition to their \
assortment of prayers.  The Oracle, being a seeker of truth and knowledge, is \
a good aligned class, meaning that they will always fumble evil prayers, and do \
not qualify for them.  Beyond 30th level, the Oracle begins to gain skills from \
other classes previously unknown to him, as the mysteries of the universe begin \
to be revealed. \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Oracle is an often consulted player, much like the Arcane \
diviner, for his ability to see beyond the obvious to the important truths \
around him.  For this reason, the Oracle may be often picked for grouping.  The \
Oracle himself, however, will need to determine if such a course is divinely \
inspired.  

SHAMAN=<CHARCLASS>\
Shaman are those who worship the gods in the most primitive and basic \
ways of the earth.  The Shaman is thus granted special powers over the \
earth by the gods, including resistances to acid attacks, at the expense \
of vulnerability to electricity.  The Shaman is a neutral \
aligned class, meaning that he will never fumble on neutral prayers, and \
has a much smaller fumble chance on good and evil prayers.  The Shaman \
is restricted to neutral weapons, any kind of armor, and gets numerous \
special prayers known only to Shaman. \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Shaman is a typical village priest, having powers from his \
deity well suited to almost any daily concern.  His neutrality shows his \
wisdom, and his power earns him respect.  The Shaman can fill almost any \
role in the game, whether it be as a group member, or a lone adventurer \
seeking an inner peace far from home.

TEMPLAR=<CHARCLASS>\
Templar are those who pursue power and glory in the name of their god.  They \
are the great weaponmasters, wielding their arms to conquer the world in \
their gods name.  The Templar can use any weapons and armor, and \
can specialize in many weapons as they increase in levels.  The Templar is \
an evil aligned class, meaning that they always fumble on good prayers, and \
do not gain any good prayers.  However, their Aura of Strife, and their \
increased number of attacks makes them a formidable foe of all who \
oppose the will of their god. \
\n\r\n\r\
How to play: The Templar is a brutal and formidable warrior, who wields death \
and power in the name of his god.  His devastating power makes him a great \
ally for groups, but also a successful glory seeker when alone.

ASSASSIN=<CHARCLASS>\
Assassins reflect the darkest and most wicked side of the rogue.  The dealing \
of death becomes a goal in itself, the epitomy of evil.  The assassin becomes \
so centered on this art that he begins to slow his pace, learning and \
contemplating each "mark" as the best method of killing them becomes clear.  \
They also learn skills in keeping track of and tracking down their marks, as \
well as other means of making life for the targeted miserable, and short. \
The assassin can use any weapons, unlike the standard thief, though his armor \
is still restricted. 

ARCANIST=<CHARCLASS>\
Also known as the Arcane Rogue, the Arcanist is the thief who has become \
fascinated with all things arcane, but has little or no innate magical power. \
He is an accumulator of wands and scrolls; making good \
use of his limited knowledge to create, improve, and most especially use \
these items to his devious ends.  Arcanists are also just knowledgable enough \
to learn spells simply by observing their usage, although, lacking any innate \
power, he forgets them as soon as they are used.

BURGLAR=<CHARCLASS>\
The burglar is the thief who has made the accumulation of wealth and power \
his center of being, to the detriment of all else.  The taking of the property \
of others by stealth, wits, or even charm makes him the bane of the rich and \
lawful alike.  This most purist of thieves also has superior skill at being \
undetected in the performance of these dastardly deeds, though he stands \
at a slight disadvantage to better trained thieves if caught.  

TRAPPER=<CHARCLASS>\
The trapper, possibly the most cowardly of thieves, has spent late nights \
tinkering with springs and switches, learning to kill indirectly through \
the devices of his art.  Trappers also view fauna as means to his ends, \
accumulating animals both live and dead with amazing efficiency.  Trappers \
alone have the greatest access to the most deadly traps, as well as \
exclusive access to skills that turn animals into his own personal play \
things, whether it be as items of sale, or as trained devilish pets.

AUCTIONS=Auctions are a system whereby players can buy and sell items from \
each other using an open bidding system.  In this system, a bidder places \
a bid which represents the most they will pay for the item.  However, a \
bidder must only end up paying an amount equal to the most anyone ELSE \
would also pay, so long as it is less than their own maximum bid. \n\r\
\n\r\
This game supports two kinds of auctions.  One is a multi-game-day auction, \
which requires that you find an auctioneer mob and use commmands like BUY, \
SELL, VIEW, and BID. The game also supports a live auction system, which is \
managed using the AUCTION command.  Only one such live auction is allowed at \
any one time.  See help on the above commands for more information.

In combat, the amount of experience you receive from the vanquishing of a foe depends partially \
on your alignment versus that of the creature you have killed.  In general, if you are Good and \
you kill a Good creature, or Evil and kill an Evil creature, or Neutral and kill a Neutral \
creature, you receive least experience.  The amount of experience can vary depending upon how close \
to perfect Goodness, perfect Evil, or pure Neutrality you are.  In addition to receiving the least amount of \
experience for violating this rule, you will find your characters alignment slowly changing with \
each repeat offense. \n\r\
\n\r\
For some classes, alignment can have other affects.  Paladins must always be good, and will find \
that their spellcasting ability disappears with their goodness.  Clerics may be good or evil, but \
their spell choices can profoundly impact their alignment.  A Good Cleric or Paladin who casts \
malicious spells will soon find themselves becoming evil.  Evil Clerics can suffer the same fate \
for using benevolent spells.

LICH=<RACE>\
Lichs are the most feared of the skeletal undead.  Although they were a normal race before they died, \
the decay and corruption makes their former race hard to determine.  Lichs lose some constitution \
for being dead, but gain charisma for their formidable presence.  In fact, they walk around with a weak \
aura of fear at all times.  Like other skeletal undead, they take half-damage from piercing or slashing \
weapons, are never hungry or thirsty, have infravision, stink of grime and decay, take damage from positive \
healing spells, are healed by negative energy spells, and are immune to poison, mind, gas, paralysis, \
disease, and negative energy attacks. The most common way to become a lich is to study Necromancy and die.

BLEEDING=\
Bleeding is when there are open wounds from which the fluid of life runs freely.  This \
is not a good state to be in.  Those who are bleeding are weak, and do not regain health. \
Their maximum movement and mana are both reduced to reflect their hit points, and hit \
points and mana are not regained while the bleeding continues.  This condition is cured in \
several ways.  One is to wait for the bleeding to stop, which may take awhile.  Another \
way is to be healed magically until you are above 50% hit points.  A final way is simply \
to be bandaged by the bandaging skill.

REPAIR=\
If your equipment falls into disrepair, you may use one of your skills to repair the \
item, or take the item to a repair shop to pay for the work to be done.  The skill \

PETS=Players, especially at lower levels, may wish to purchase or charm animals or \
other creatures to follow them.  These creatures are called pets, and will usually \
assist the player in combat.  This can aid a player who has trouble surviving, though \

number of pets or followers you can have depends on your Charisma score.

HOMES=\
Players may purchase and develop property of their own to serve as their online home \
away from home.  \n\r\

that is for sale.  Such properties will typically include a message such as "This lot \
is for sale.".  After finding such a property, the player should enter LOOK ID to \
discover the properties unique lot number identifier.  Write this down!\n\r\
\n\r\
The next step is to find the local Property dealer for that area.  He shouldn't be \
too far away!  Some property dealers deal in player property, and some only deal \
with Clans.  Make sure you find the right one to buy your lot from.  When the \
property dealer is found, you can use your lot number to purchase the correct \
lot from the dealer.\n\r\
\n\r\
Once the property is purchased, you will need to develop it.  Skills such as \
Masonry, Construction, and Locksmithing are used to develop the properties \
you purchase.  If you don't have these skills, or don't want them, you might be \
able to find mobs nearby which you may HIRE to perform these tasks.

your class and level, though it will also depend a great deal upon your \
character's Strength.

of certain Druidic chants, lots of time.  Legacy remorting is done through your \
children.  Children are created by using the MATE social with a member of the \
opposite sex while the both of you are suitably undressed.  If pregnancy occurs \
in the female, birth will occur some 10 mud-months following this, though the \
time required to give birth is highly race-dependent.  The child \
should remain in the mothers inventory until it can walk, which occurs 9 mud- \
months following birth (more or less, depending on race again).  If the baby \
is Christened by a Cleric with a player \
legal name, and if the child remains as a follower of either the \
father or the mother until it grows up, it will become a player, which occurs \
18-27 mud-months after birth.  If the child does not remain an active follower, \
or if it is never Christened, it will grow up to be a mob, or perhaps not grow \
up at all! Should the named child grow up, the child will cease to be a following mob, and become a \
player which can be logged-in as.  The child may be a mixed breed of the mother \
and father if one of them is a Human and the other is not.  Racial benefits will be \
split between the mother and father, though children will have a bonus to one of their \
maximum stats when they become a player, making them a good choice for playing!

but can have tangible benefits for players as well.\n\r\
\n\r\

blessings given by and the rituals demanded by each deity. Once a player \
is a worshipper of a deity, they may use the rituals to receive one of the \
listed blessings.  Gods may have alignment or other requirements which, \
if broken, can bring their wrath down upon those they rebuke.\n\r\

skill to convert the player to the worship of their deity.  Clerics may \

When the first step of a service is performed successfully, any npc mobs within \
a particular range from the service location who worship the same deity will \
make their way to the room to hear or even participate in the service.  At the \
end of the service, the cleric performing it will receive experience based on the \
number and levels of the faithful mobs and players present.  A service may only be performed \
in a particular area for a particular deity once every 30 minutes.

REPUTATION=\
Reputation refers to the feelings that mobs in particular places, or particular races, or with particular names have \
about each player.  Reputation can be gained or lost on a per-Area basis, a per-Race basis, or for each individual mob name. \
By default, players start off with a Neutral reputation, meaning that the mobs will not react one way or another towards the player. \
Player behavior towards the mobs, over time, will increase or decrease reputation.  \n\r\
\n\r\
Reputation is increased from neutral to Liked, Loved, and Hero by the following methods: \n\r\
1. Peacefully hanging around the mobs for a long time, or within their Area for Area-based reputation.\n\r\
2. Chatting with mobs who will talk to players will increase reputation even faster than simply hanging around them.\n\r\
3. Giving mobs money will increase reputation with them, though this benefit decreases as the mobs become richer.\n\r\
\n\r\
When a players is Liked by mobs, the mobs will be in a brighter mood when around the player.  \
When Loved, the mobs will be more chatty with the player, may cast benevolent spells on them, and will seem \
slightly more charismatic (for area based reputation).  When a Hero, the mobs will do all the above, as well \
as guard the player from aggression.  A Hero player will not be attacked by aggressive mobs. \n\r\
\n\r\
Reputation is decreased from neutral to Disliked, Hated, and Villain by one of two methods: \n\r\
1. Killing them.\n\r\
2. Getting arrested (for area based reputation).\n\r\
\n\r\
When a players is Disliked by mobs, the mobs will be in a more sour mood when around the player.  \
When Hated, the mobs will be slightly more aggressive towards the player.  When a Villain, the mobs go out \
of their way to slaughter the player, even if normally peaceful. \n\r\
\n\r\

PAST_LIFE=When a character REMORTs, they gain achievement(s) based on the classes and levels in those classes \
that they have at the instance before REMORTing. Remort achievements are numbered to display how many times a \
character must remort at or above the level requirement to gain that achievement (and the associated benefits). \
All Remort benefits are cumulative, so a level 90 character with 60 levels of fighter and 30 levels of barbarian \
would gain a fighter past life achievement, a fighter savant past life achievement and a barbarian past life \
achievement. Remorting a subsequent time in the same class would increment the Past Life number, so a player will \
receive the benefits of Past Life II on the next REMORT after receiving the Past Life I achievement from a particular \
class. The bonuses from each of those achievements are also cumulative, so if two achievements each offer a \
Attack +2 bonus, then all subsequent characters on the account would gain Attack +4. Skills and Expertises are granted \
for free at the level indicated. For specific achievement rewards from remorting, see help (class) past life I, (class) savant past \
life I, and prodigal (class) past life I.

SLAVE=A slave is an intelligent mob broken down and sold to a liege master. \
Once enslaved, a mob can be sold to slave traders with the Slave Trading skill, \
brought to the players \
clan homes or personal homes to remain as permanent residents, ORDERed as \
vassals of the owner, and, of course, command them to perform tasks.  Tasks \
for the slave to perform must be directed to the slave with the SAY command, \
and must begin with the words "I command you to" or "I order you to".  The \
slave will then wander around as in a GEAS trying to perform the task.  The \
slave can be released from the task by saying "cancel" to them.  Slaves are \
different from pets in that they require food and drink to survive.  If given \
the food and water, they will eat and drink as necessary from what they have \
been given.  Slaves eventually lose loyalty as well.  If they starve, or if \
they take damage for any reason, their loyalty will decrease, making them \
more and more likely to leave their masters homes, or attack their masters.
