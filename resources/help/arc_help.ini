CATALOG=\
Command  : CATALOG\n\r\
Usage    : CATALOG LIST (MOBS/ITEMS/) (NAME MASK)\n\r\
Usage    : CATALOG (DELETE) [ITEM/MOB NAME]\n\r\
Usage    : CATALOG (ROOM/AREA/WORLD) (MOBS/ITEMS/)\n\r\
Usage    : CATALOG EDIT [ITEM NAME]\n\r\
Usage    : CATALOG SCAN/DBSCAN (ROOM/AREA/WORLD) (MOBS/ITEMS/)\n\r\
Usage    : CATALOG OVERLOOK/DBOVERLOOK (ROOM/AREA/WORLD) (MOBS/ITEMS/)\n\r\
Example  : catalog list\n\r\

Example  : catalog delete the waiter\n\r\
Example  : catalog edit the sword\n\r\
Example  : catalog room mobs\n\r\
Example  : catalog scan area\n\r\
Example  : catalog dboverlook area mobs\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
This command is used to manage your muds global catalog of generic mobs and/or items. \
The catalog is a place where you can store templates of mobs and items for reuse, \
or for quick global modification and analysis.  Mobs and items in your catalog \
can be changed globally simply by creating and then changing any instance of one \
of them.  You can create \
new instances of a cataloged object simply by entering CREATE <cataloged object name>. \
Your catalog is keyed by name, so once the name of a cataloged item or mob is set, it \
should not be changed. \
\n\r\n\r\
You may review the objects in your catalog using the catalog list command. You can also \
check the catalog synchronicity of the objects in your live rooms with scan, or your \
saved rooms with dbscan.  You can check for uncataloged objects in live rooms with the \
overlook parameter, or in your saved rooms with dboverlook. \
\n\r\n\r\
You may delete an object from your catalog to stop using it as a global template. \
Deleting an object from the catalog only detaches instances of a cataloged object from \
all others, but does not destroy any actual instances.\
\n\r\n\r\
The catalog is also used to manage a global random item-drop table.  Items can be set to \
randomly appear in the inventories of selected mobs when those mobs are brought to life, or \
at the moment of their death. Use CATALOG EDIT <item name> to change drop settings.

CLOAK=\
Command  : CLOAK\n\r\
Usage    : CLOAK (OFF)\n\r\
Example  : cloak\n\r\
Example  : cloak off\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
Cloak makes the player unable to be seen in the WHO list.  They can \
still be seen by players in the same room, however.

COPY=\
Command : COPY\n\r\
Usage   : COPY ([NUMBER]) [ITEM TYPE]/[DIRECTION] \n\r\

Example : create StdExit east\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
A command for the creation of items, mobs, quests, rooms, polls, exits, classes, races, etc. \
Enter CREATE for more information on command usage on items, mobs, components, and exits. \
Use AHELP QUESTS for more information on creating quests.

Example : destroy item longsword@an orc\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
A command for the destruction of items, quests, components, mobs, rooms, exits, polls, classes, races, \
and listed bugs, typos, ideas, and ban. \
Enter DESTROY for more information on command usage.
	
DEVIATIONS=\
Command : DEVIATIONS\n\r\
Usage   : DEVIATIONS [MOBS/ITEMS/BOTH] [MASK]/ROOM/AREA \n\r\
Example : deviations mobs area\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
A command for showing items in a room or area, and how they \
deviate from established norms for their type and level.
	
EXPIRE=\
Command : EXPIRE\n\r\
Usage   : EXPIRE [PLAYERNAME] ([NEW DAYS REMAINING]) \n\r\

is only relevant if the account expiration system is enabled in your coffeemud.ini file.

GENERATE=\
Command : GENERATE\n\r\
Usage   : GENERATE [OBJ TYPE] [ID] (FROM [FILENAME]) ([VAR]=[VAL]...) ([DIRECTION])\n\r\
Example : generate area maze_dungeon from examples/randomdata.xml areasize=50 areaname=test \
level_range=10?20 aggrochance=50 theme=kobolds south\n\r\
Example : generate string list\n\r\
\n\r\
This command uses an xml file to generate random content for your mud.  This content can \
be anything from whole areas, to rooms, mobs, items, or simple strings. By default, the \
content is built from the file in resources/examples/randomdata.xml, though the builder \
may specify his or her own xml file path as one of the many arguments.  The arguments, \
briefly, are:\n\r\
\n\r\
OBJ TYPE: One of the following: AREA, ROOM, MOB, ITEM, or STRING.\n\r\
\n\r\
ID      : one of the "id" xml attributes defined on any tag in the XML file. \
Use GENERATE STRING LIST for a list of all "id" attributes defined in your file.\n\r\
\n\r\
FROM "F": An optional argument to specify your own xml file, with the resources \
directory being the default root.\n\r\
\n\r\
VAR=VAL : One or more variables and their definitions.  Many tags will have a specific set of required \
variables which must be defined in order for the content to be generated.  Failing to specify \
one of the required variables will cause an error message listing the variables which must \
be defined, and the type of data required for the variable.  Variable types which list numbers \
as their data types may also have math expressions values (so you can use random numbers).  See \
the help on MATH EXPRESSION for more information on this.  In addition to required variables, you \
may also use the space to enter one or more "override" values.  Many object fields (such as LEVEL \
for mobs and items, or NAME, etc) as well as the XML id tags, can have their "random" values overridden \
by defining them using the generate command.\n\r\
\n\r\
DIRECTION: This applies only to ROOM and AREA object types.  The object, if successfully generated, will \
be linked to the current room that the player is standing in, in the direction they specify.\n\r\
\n\r\
In closing, the GENERATE command is an interesting way to deliver large amounts of dynamic content \
for your world, though it can never replace the caring touch of a real, creative builder.  If \
anyone is interested in writing their own xml content, please open up the examples/randomdata.xml \
file and begin reading. Use that file as an example on how to construct your own.

I3_CHANNELS=\
Command  : I3 CHANNELS\n\r\
Usage    : I3 CHANNELS\n\r\
Example  : i3 channels\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\

which your mud does not subscribe to.

RESET_ROOM=RESET
RESET_AREA=RESET
RESET_REJUV=RESET
RESET_MOBSTATS=RESET
RESET_ITEMSTATS=RESET
RESET=\
Command  : RESET\n\r\
Usage    : RESET (REJUV) ROOM/AREA (ITEMS/MOBS)\n\r\
Usage    : RESET MOBSTATS ROOM/AREA/WORLD/CATALOG (NOSAVE) ([AREANAME])\n\r\
Usage    : RESET ITEMSTATS ROOM/AREA/WORLD/CATALOG (NOSAVE) ([AREANAME])\n\r\
Example  : reset room\n\r\
Example  : reset area\n\r\
Example  : reset rejuv area items\n\r\
Example  : reset mobstats world\n\r\
Example  : reset itemstats catalog nosave midgaard\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
The reset room or area command will revive any wandered or \
dead mobs whose location is the same as the invokers.  Any \
removed items which are resettable will also return.  Any items \
or mobs which do not belong in the location will be returned to \
their proper homes.\n\r\
\n\r\
The reset rejuv room or area command will revive any dead mobs or \
resettable items at the location of the invoker.  Mobs that have \
wandered away will not be returned.  No other mobs or items in the \
room will be affected.\n\r\
\n\r\
The reset itemstats and reset mobstats commands serve a similar \
purpose.  Both will modify the vital statistics of all the mobs \
or items in the room, area, world, or catalog specified.  The \
statistics will be "normalizations" of vital combat scores based \
on the mob or items level, and the game engine's definition of \
nominal ratings for that level.  They will \
allow a "preview" of changes to be made by specifying the "nosave" \
parameter on the command line, which prevents permanent changes.  \
Area names may also be specified on the command line to cause the \
command to skip certain areas (for use with WORLD parameter only).

LIST=\
Command : LIST\n\r\
Usage   : LIST ([SHOPKEEPER])\n\r\
Example : list\n\r\
Example : list quests\n\r\

TITLES, NOPURGE, BANNED, RACECATS, LOG, USERS, LINKAGES, REPORTS, THREADS, \
RESOURCES, ONEWAYDOORS, CHANTS, POWERS, SUPERPOWERS, \
FACTIONS, MATERIALS, OBJCOUNTERS, POLLS, CONTENTS, BUGS, TYPOS, IDEAS, TASKS, \
or ASSISTS. depending upon the listers security.

Usage   : NOPURGE [PLAYER NAME]\n\r\
Example : nopurge bob\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
Makes a player inelligible for purging by the autopurge system.  Use LIST NOPURGE, \
or DESTROY NOPURGE for maintaining the list.

Example : load ability /myclasses/blah.class\n\r\
Example : load weapon /myclasses/blah2.class\n\r\
Example : load class com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.Items.Weapons.Sword.class\n\r\
Example : load weapon com/planet_ink/coffee_mud/Items/Weapons/Sword.java\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
A command for the loading of resources, faction ini files, or class files of \
java or javascript.\n\r\
\n\r\
Use LIST RESOURCES to see a list of resources.\n\r\
\n\r\
For class files, the LIST command can also show whats already loaded.  This command \
will automatically attempt to unload a class if it is already loaded.  If the specified \
class is a java source file or javascript, it will attempt to compile it first.  \
For loading classes, the second parameter may be the word "class" and the system \
will attempt to correct your ambiguity.  If it is unable to determine the type of \
class being loaded, however, you may get an error.  It is therefore better just \
to use the load [CLASS-TYPE] syntax instead.
	
MODIFY=\
Command : MODIFY\n\r\
Usage   : MODIFY [ITEM TYPE] ... \n\r\
Example : modify room name The Grassy Knole\n\r\

listed must already appear in your coffeemud.ini file.  This command \
will silence all traffic to your server from that channel.

I3_DELETE=\
Command : I3 DELETE\n\r\
Usage   : I3 DELETE [LOCAL CHANNEL NAME]\n\r\
Example : i3 delete BADCHAN\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
Sends a remove-channel message to the InterMud3 router.  The channel \
listed must already appear in your coffeemud.ini file.

IMPORT=\
Command  : IMPORT\n\r\
Usage    : IMPORT (NOPROMPT) [COMPLETE PATH AND FILE NAME(S)] \n\r\
Example  : import /areas/myarea.cmare\n\r\
Example  : import noprompt /areas/midgaard.are\n\r\
Example  : import /areas/midgaard.are /areas/school.are\n\r\

Example  : import noprompt /areas/\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
The import command will allow you to import official coffeemud \
area files, whose extension is "*.cmare"\n\r\
CoffeeMud may also import, with varying levels of success, the "*.are" \
files used by other muds.  Some formats are better supported \
than others, so be sure to carefully examine the imported \
area afterwards.\n\r\
The import command will auto detect, based on the file given, \
whether the file refers to a coffeemud area file, room file, \
a "*.are" from another mud, or a "*.lst" list of other area \
files.\n\r\
The CoffeeMud "resources" directory is the default path.  Remember \
that all paths in CoffeeMud treat the install directory as "root'. \
This means that the files being imported must be copied into a \
folder underneath your install directory before use.  See the help \
on VFS for more information on this concept.

MERGE=\
Command  : MERGE\n\r\
Usage    : MERGE (AREA/ROOM) (CHANGE=[FIELD,..]) (ON=[FIELD,..]) (IGNORE=[FIELD,..]) [PATH & FILE NAME]\n\r\

Example  : merge change=damage,level,ability /myfiles/myweapons.cmare\n\r\
Example  : merge area change=material ignore=level /myfiles/myweapons.cmare\n\r\
Example  : merge change=damage on=name /myfiles/weapons.cmare\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
Allows you to selectively modify all instances of a mob or item in the world \
based on the contents of a CMARE file containing items or mobs.  These files \
are generated using the EXPORT (WORLD/AREA/ROOM) (ITEMS/WEAPONS) command. \
The first parameter specifies whether the items in the text file are to be \
merged with those in the entire world, in your current area, or just the room. \
The second parameter (CHANGE) is implied to be ALL unless specified otherwise. \
It denotes which fields in the existing items may be changed based on what \
changes are seen to the item inside the CMARE file.   The third parameter \
(ON) is implied to be ALL unless specified otherwise.  It denotes how an item \
in the CMARE file is matched with an existing item in your world.  If the \
listed fields from the CMARE file and the existing item are equal, the items \
will be considered a match for the purposes of merging.  The fourth parameter \
(IGNORE) is implied to be NONE unless specified otherwise.  It denotes \
exceptions to the (ON) parameter, namely which fields are allowed to differ \
between items in the CMARE file and an existing item in cases where they would \
otherwise be considered a match according to the (ON) parameter.  Matched \
items in your existing world, in every room, will be modified accordingly, and \
the room will be resaved to your database.  The log will reflect all changes \
made to your world.  Every room in every area in your world will be reloaded \
from the database prior to any evaluations or changes.

EXPORT=\
Command : EXPORT\n\r\
Usage   : EXPORT (AREA/ROOM/WORLD/PLAYER) (DATA/ITEMS/MOBS/WEAPONS/ARMOR) ([FILE]/SCREEN/EMAIL)\n\r\

Example : export area weapons /home/users/myarea\n\r\
Example : export area screen\n\r\
Example : export area email\n\r\
Example : export world data /exportfiles/\n\r\
Example : export player bob\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
The export command will generate the official coffeemud area files, \
whose extension is "*.cmare".  This command may also be used to export \
individual rooms, player data, or unique items or mobs as well.  If the second parameter \
(ITEMS/MOBS/WEAPONS/etc) is NOT specified, export will produce full \
room data for the scope of the first parameter (AREA, ROOM, or WORLD). \
If the second parameter IS specified, then only the specified data will \
be generated.\n\r\
The results will be written to the file given in the last argument, or to the \
screen if "screen" is given as the last argument, or sent to your email address \
if that is enabled.  The extension need not be \
included, as coffeemud will add it if not present.  If a directory name \
is given (no file name), the system will reference the AREA ARCHIVE file \
name for an Area, assuming EXPORT AREA or EXPORT WORLD is used. The default \
directory for this command is the CoffeeMud root.

ORDER=\
Command : ORDER\n\r\
Usage   : ORDER [TARGET NAME] [COMMAND(S)]\n\r\
Example : order dog flee\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command will allow you to force a mob to perform any command \
listed in the COMMANDS or SOCIALS list.
	
POOF=\
Command : POOF\n\r\
Usage   : POOF\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
For players with access to the GOTO command, this command will allow the admin to change \
the messages seen when they leave and enter a room via GOTO.  The S-NAME, S-HIM-HER and \
other codes may be used so that the admins name is properly presented.  Remember to \
surround the codes with the less-than and greater-than tag markers!

PURGE=\
Command : PURGE\n\r\
Usage   : PURGE [ITEM TYPE] ... \n\r\
Example : purge orc\n\r\
Example : purge item longsword\n\r\
Example : purge item longsword@an orc\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command is a weak form of DESTROY, allowing only items and mobs to be \
destroyed.  Rejuvinating mobs will still rejuvinate when purge is used, unlike \
destroy.
	
SNOOP=\

to see information gathered since midnight.  You may also enter a number \
and a scale (days, weeks, months, or years) to view information going \
farther back.\n\r\
\n\r\
STAT will also allow you to retreive basic stat information on a player \
or mob in the game.  Entering STAT and the players name brings up the \
most basic SCORE information.  Including a skill type before the name \
will list their abilities of that type.  Valid skill types include: SKILL, \
SPELL, PRAYER, SONG, TRAP, PROPERTY, "THIEF SKILL", LANGUAGE, CHANT, \
"COMMON SKILL", DISEASE, POISON.  You can also get special reports by \
entering one of the following before the name: EQUIPMENT, COMBAT, INVENTORY, \
QUESTWINS, TATTOOS, TITLES, SCRIPTS, WORLDEXPLORED, AREASEXPLORED, ROOMSEXPLORED, \
FACTIONS

be retreived from the container.  The very special item name "qp" \
may be used to take Quest Points from players using this command. 

SHUTDOWN=\

Example : gmodify area class=genmob&&name=the cityguard change=name=the guard\n\r\
Example : gmodify world class=[cs]GenMob&&name=[ss]city change=name=[ss]\n\r\
Example : gmodify ?\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
A command to select objects in a given area, room, or the whole world \
based on the specified field values, and optionally change some of \
those specified fields.\n\r\
\n\r\
Searching the entire world is implied, but the first parameter may be \
the word AREA or ROOM to narrow the search.  You may also enter WORLD \
to make the world search explicit.\n\r\
\n\r\
The next parameter is the search criteria.  \
The key phrase WHEN= may optionally precede it to \
make explicit that you are specifying the search criteria.  The search \
criteria fields may be separated by && strings to specify that all of the \
preceding criteria AND the next single criteria must be true.  The criteria \
fields may also be separated by || strings to specify that all of the preceding \
criteria OR the next single criteria may be true.  One of those strings must \
be present when specifying more than one criteria.\n\r\
\n\r\
Each field in the search criteria must be of the form FIELD=VALUE, FIELD!=VALUE, \
FIELD$VALUE, FIELD>VALUE, FIELD<VALUE, FIELD>=VALUE, or FIELD<=VALUE.  Where \
FIELD must be a valid search field.  Enter GMODIFY ? for a complete list of all \
valid fields.  Not all fields will apply to all object types, so take this into \
account especially when using < or != operators.  The operators are all normal \
except for the new one, $, which means that the value is really a regular expression. \
The VALUE portion of the criteria may be prefixed with modifiers, which include: \n\r\
[ss] to specify that the value refers to a substring of the fields whole value.\n\r\
[cs] to specify that the search is case sensitive (case insensitive is implied).\n\r\
\n\r\
The last parameter is the optional change specifications.  These specifications \
must be prefixed with the key phrase CHANGE=.  If these specifications are not \
included, GMODIFY will display the results of the search.  The change specifications \
are similar to the search criteria in that they consist of groupings of FIELD=VALUE \
separated by && strings.  Unlike search criteria, however, operators other than =, and \
strings other than || have no special meaning.  The fields, like in the search \
criteria, must be valid fields for the options selected by the search criteria.  The \
fields on the object will be changed to the specified value UNLESS the following \
conditions are met: the VALUE portion of a field is prefixed with the modifier [ss], \
and the VALUE portion of an identical field in the search criteria was also prefixed with \
the modifier [ss].  Under those special conditions, instead of substituting the entire \
field value on the object with the new value, ONLY the portion of the string selected \
in the search criteria will be substituted.

Short(s): .\n\r\
This command allows the archon, and users with appropriate FS: and/or VFS: security \
flags to access the file system and/or the virtual file system.  See help on CMFS \
or VFS for the difference between the two.\n\r\
\n\r\
The commands are case-insensitive, except where dealing with the local file system, where \
it may be case-sensitive depending upon the host system.  As mentioned in the CMFS docs, \
filenames and paths may be preceded by a :: string to denote forced VFS access, or // \
to denote forced local file-system access.  When neither is specified for a given \
shell command, the VFS file is always preferred. The / character is always used to separate \
directory paths and folders, such as /resources/text/down.txt would refer to the file \
down.txt in the text folder, which in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is \
located in the root directory.\n\r\
\n\r\
The shell command may be entered with no parameter to see the players current directory. \
When viewing directories, a "-" character will precede a file which exists only in the \
VFS system.  A "+" character will precede a file which exists in both the local file \
system and the VFS system.  Since folders always exist in the VFS, they will always \
be seen with the "+" character preceding them.\n\r\
\n\r\
The shell command can be used to create directories, delete files or directories, \
copy files, search for files with given names, search inside text files for a \
text string, display a text file, or edit a text file.  Many commands support a \
mask to limit the files displayed. The mask may include "*" characters anywhere \
in the string to match 0 or more unknown characters in the filenames.  A "?" \
character always matches a single unknown character in a filename. \n\r\
\n\r\
See HELP CMFS for more information on CoffeeMuds file system.

MASKS=\
In numerous parameters, places, and input fields, CoffeeMud will ask you for something \
called a "Zapper Mask".  The mask is used to help select particular mobs, items, etc \
from the universe of available selections by "filtering out" those you don't want. \
For example, if you wanted to only select mobs named Bob, you would compose a mask \
that Disallows non-mobs, and Disallows things that dont have the name Bob.  This is \
done using the Zapper Mask syntax, shown below:\n\r\
<ZAP=disallow>

ZAPPER_MASKS=MASKS

ABILITY_PREREQS=\
Ability Prerequisites is a comma delimited list of skills or skill masks that describe \
what skills or set of skills must be learned, and at what optional proficiency, before \
a player of a given class can learn that skill.  The list is comma delimited, and each \
item in the list consists of a valid Ability ID (like Spell_Fireball), or a wildcard \
mask of Ability_IDs (like Spell_F* to select all Ability IDs beginning with Spell_F). \
Following the Ability_ID is an optionally number in parenthesis, which would represent \
the minimum proficiency of the aforementioned Ability that is required.\n\r\
Example:\n\r\
Skill_Trip(50),Fighter_*(10)\n\r\
The above means that the current ability requires that the player have Trip at 50% \
proficiency and any Fighter skill at 10% proficiency or better.
