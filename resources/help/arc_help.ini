Example  : catalog room mobs\n\r\
Example  : catalog scan area\n\r\
Example  : catalog dboverlook area mobs\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
This command is used to manage your muds global catalog of generic mobs and/or items. \
The catalog is a place where you can store templates of mobs and items for reuse, \
or for quick global modification and analysis.  Mobs and items in your catalog \
can be changed globally simply by creating and then changing any instance of one \
of them.  You can create \
new instances of a cataloged object simply by entering CREATE <cataloged object name>. \
Your catalog is keyed by name, so once the name of a cataloged item or mob is set, it \
should not be changed. \
\n\r\n\r\
Cataloged items can be placed into categories by issueing the catalog category command \
before adding or modifying catalog entries.  Mobs and items so cataloged must still \
have a unique global name, but flagging them this way can make listing them must easier. \
\n\r\n\r\
You may review the objects in your catalog using the catalog list command. You can also \
check the catalog synchronicity of the objects in your live rooms with scan, or your \
saved rooms with dbscan.  You can check for uncataloged objects in live rooms with the \
overlook parameter, or in your saved rooms with dboverlook. \
\n\r\n\r\
You may delete an object from your catalog to stop using it as a global template. \
Deleting an object from the catalog only detaches instances of a cataloged object from \
all others, but does not destroy any actual instances.\
\n\r\n\r\
The catalog is also used to manage a global random item-drop table.  Items can be set to \
randomly appear in the inventories of selected mobs when those mobs are brought to life, or \
at the moment of their death. Use CATALOG EDIT <item name> to change drop settings.

CLOAK=\

Example : every mob cast tourettes *\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command allows you to execute a command against every room, item, mob, or exit in the same room \
as the Archon.  The name of the target can be substituted in your command with an asterisk *.  The \
INAREA or INWORLD flag may be given to expand the rooms affected.  The +PLAYERS flag will include players \
when the MOB argument is given.  A ZapperMask may be placed between <MASK> and </MASK> strings to filter \

Example : generate area maze_dungeon from randareas/example.xml areasize=50 "areaname= the test" \
level_range=10?20 aggrochance=50 theme=kobolds south\n\r\
Example : generate string list\n\r\
\n\r\
This command uses an xml file to generate random content for your mud.  This content can \
be anything from whole areas, to rooms, mobs, items, or simple strings. By default, the \
content is built from the file in resources/randareas/example.xml, though the builder \
may specify his or her own xml file path as one of the many arguments.  The arguments, \
briefly, are:\n\r\
\n\r\
OBJ TYPE: One of the following: AREA, ROOM, MOB, ITEM, or STRING.\n\r\
\n\r\
ID      : one of the "id" xml attributes defined on any tag in the XML file. \
Use GENERATE STRING LIST for a list of all "id" attributes defined in your file.\n\r\
\n\r\
FROM "F": An optional argument to specify your own xml file, with the resources \
directory being the default root.\n\r\
\n\r\
VAR=VAL : One or more variables and their definitions.  Many tags will have a specific set of required \
variables which must be defined in order for the content to be generated.  Failing to specify \
one of the required variables will cause an error message listing the variables which must \
be defined, and the type of data required for the variable.  Variable types which list numbers \
as their data types may also have math expressions values (so you can use random numbers).  See \
the help on MATH EXPRESSION for more information on this.  In addition to required variables, you \
may also use the space to enter one or more "override" values.  Many object fields (such as LEVEL \
for mobs and items, or NAME, etc) as well as the XML id tags, can have their "random" values overridden \
by defining them using the generate command.  If you need to use a space in a variable value, enclose \
the ENTIRE definition in quotes, such as "areaname=the dungeon" instead of areaname="the dungeon".\n\r\
\n\r\
DIRECTION: This applies only to ROOM and AREA object types.  The object, if successfully generated, will \
be linked to the current room that the player is standing in, in the direction they specify.\n\r\
\n\r\
In closing, the GENERATE command is an interesting way to deliver large amounts of dynamic content \
for your world, though it can never replace the caring touch of a real, creative builder.  If \
anyone is interested in writing their own xml content, please open up the /resources/randareas/example.xml \
file and begin reading. Use that file as an example on how to construct your own.

I3_CHANNELS=\
Command  : I3 CHANNELS\n\r\
Usage    : I3 CHANNELS\n\r\
Example  : i3 channels\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
Lists all the channels available on the InterMud3 network, even those \
which your mud does not subscribe to.

JCONSOLE=\
Command : JCONSOLE\n\r\
Usage   : JCONSOLE [TOPICNAME]\n\r\
Example : jconsole ([statement])\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
When entered with a statement, this command will execute the single javascript statement \
and exit.  When entered alone, it will enter a console where the user can enter as many \
javascript statements as they want, and the system will even remember any variables or \
functions they've defined later one (does NOT survive reboots!).  All the Scriptable/MOBPROG \
commands and functions are also available, though the commands and functions must be entered \
in ALL UPPERCASE, and commands must have their parameters separated by commas instead of spaces, \
be put into quotes, and surrounded by parenthesis like javascript function calls.  \
Lastly, for entering multi-line data, you can enter multi line mode by entering < by itself, \
and exiting by entering > by itself.

Example  : reset itemstats catalog nosave midgaard\n\r\
Example  : reset password krogon\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
The reset room or area command will revive any wandered or \
dead mobs whose location is the same as the invokers.  Any \
removed items which are resettable will also return.  Any items \
or mobs which do not belong in the location will be returned to \
their proper homes.\n\r\
\n\r\
The reset rejuv room or area command will revive any dead mobs or \
resettable items at the location of the invoker.  Mobs that have \
wandered away will not be returned.  No other mobs or items in the \
room will be affected.\n\r\
\n\r\
The reset itemstats and reset mobstats commands serve a similar \
purpose.  Both will modify the vital statistics of all the mobs \
or items in the room, area, world, or catalog specified.  The \
statistics will be "normalizations" of vital combat scores based \
on the mob or items level, and the game engine's definition of \
nominal ratings for that level.  They will \
allow a "preview" of changes to be made by specifying the "nosave" \
parameter on the command line, which prevents permanent changes.  \
Area names may also be specified on the command line to cause the \
command to skip certain areas (for use with WORLD parameter only).\n\r\
\n\r\
Reset relevel is a dangerous but potentially time saving command to \
change the levels of all mobs and items in the same area as the user from \
falling within its current range of levels to a new range.  See help \
[areaname] to see the existing minimum and maximum levels of the area. \
\n\r\
The reset password command will let you generate a random password \
for the given player or account and email it to their address on file, \
or change it to a neutral word when no email address is on file.\n\r\
\n\r\
You can also reload your ini settings, or the lists.ini file using \
reset inifile.

will automatically attempt to unload a class if it is already loaded.  If the specified \
class is a java source file or javascript, it will attempt to compile it first.  \
For loading classes, the second parameter may be the word "class" and the system \
will attempt to correct your ambiguity.  If it is unable to determine the type of \
class being loaded, however, you may get an error.  It is therefore better just \
to use the load [CLASS-TYPE] syntax instead.

Example : idea review 7\n\r\
Example : idea review bob 7\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command can be used to submit ideas to the system.  When \
the REVIEW parameter is given, the ideas will be iterated through \
one at a time to give the archon a chance to delete, comment on, \
or email each one.  An optional starting number can be given to REVIEW. \
An optional filter can be given to list only messages assigned to a particular user.

IMPORT=\
Command  : IMPORT\n\r\
Usage    : IMPORT (NOPROMPT) (NODELETE) (AREATYPE=TYPE) [FILE NAME(S)] \n\r\
Example  : import /areas/myarea.cmare\n\r\
Example  : import noprompt nodelete /areas/midgaard.are\n\r\
Example  : import areatype=stdthininstance /areas/midgaard.are /areas/school.are\n\r\
Example  : import noprompt /areas/areas.lst\n\r\
Example  : import noprompt /areas/\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
The import command will allow you to import official coffeemud \
area files, whose extension is "*.cmare"\n\r\
CoffeeMud may also import, with varying levels of success, the "*.are" \
files used by other muds.  Some formats are better supported \
than others, so be sure to carefully examine the imported \
area afterwards.\n\r\
The import command will auto detect, based on the file given, \
whether the file refers to a coffeemud area file, room file, \
a "*.are" from another mud, or a "*.lst" list of other area \
files.\n\r\
The CoffeeMud "resources" directory is the default path.  Remember \
that all paths in CoffeeMud treat the install directory as "root'. \
This means that the files being imported must be copied into a \
folder underneath your install directory before use.  See the help \
on VFS for more information on this concept.

MERGE=\
Command  : MERGE\n\r\
Usage    : MERGE (AREA/ROOM) (CHANGE=[FIELD,..]) (ON=[FIELD,..]) (IGNORE=[FIELD,..]) [PATH & FILE NAME]\n\r\
Usage    : MERGE (AREA/ROOM) DATABASE (MOBS/ITEMS/ROOMS) DBCLASS=[JAVACLASS] DBSERVICE=[DB SERVICE URL]\n\r\
:        :       DBUSER=[USERNAME] DBPASS=[PASSWORD] (IGNORE=[FIELD,..]) (MASK=[ZAPPERMASK])\n\r\
Example  : merge /myfiles/myitems.cmare\n\r\
Example  : merge change=damage,level,ability /myfiles/myweapons.cmare\n\r\
Example  : merge area change=material ignore=level /myfiles/myweapons.cmare\n\r\
Example  : merge change=damage on=name /myfiles/weapons.cmare\n\r\
Example  : merge area database dbclass=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver dbservice=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db\n\r\
:        :            dbuser=username dbpass=password ignore="IMG,ATTACK" MASK="-NAMES +Bob"\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
Allows you to selectively modify all instances of a mob or item in the world \
based on the contents of a CMARE file containing items or mobs, or another \
CoffeeMud database. \n\r\
\n\r\
When using CMARE files, the files must be \
generated using the EXPORT (WORLD/AREA/ROOM) (ITEMS/WEAPONS) command. \
The first parameter specifies whether the items in the text file are to be \
merged with those in the entire world, in your current area, or just the room. \
The second parameter (CHANGE) is implied to be ALL unless specified otherwise. \
It denotes which fields in the existing items may be changed based on what \
changes are seen to the item inside the CMARE file.   The third parameter \
(ON) is implied to be ALL unless specified otherwise.  It denotes how an item \
in the CMARE file is matched with an existing item in your world.  If the \
listed fields from the CMARE file and the existing item are equal, the items \
will be considered a match for the purposes of merging.  The fourth parameter \
(IGNORE) is implied to be NONE unless specified otherwise.  It denotes \
exceptions to the (ON) parameter, namely which fields are allowed to differ \
between items in the CMARE file and an existing item in cases where they would \
otherwise be considered a match according to the (ON) parameter.  Matched \
items in your existing world, in every room, will be modified accordingly, and \
the room will be resaved to your database.  The log will reflect all changes \
made to your world.  Every room in every area in your world will be reloaded \
from the database prior to any evaluations or changes.\n\r\
\n\r\
When using a database as a source, the merge command will compare and match the \
database version of the room contents with the local world.  The user is then \
given the opportunity to make changes to the local world depending on differences. \
The merge requires DBCLASS, DBSERVICE, DBUSER, and DBPASS parameters be set.  The \
IGNORE parameters is a comma delimited list of fields to ignore when displaying \
differences.  To mask the types of objects checked, the user can specify mobs, items, \
or the whole rooms after the word database, and a zappermask can be included after the \
mask parameters.

EXPORT=\
Command : EXPORT\n\r\
Usage   : EXPORT (AREA/ROOM/WORLD/CATALOG/PLAYER) (DATA/ITEMS/MOBS/WEAPONS/ARMOR) ([FILE]/SCREEN/EMAIL)\n\r\
Example : export room myroom\n\r\
Example : export area /home/users/myarea\n\r\
Example : export area weapons /home/users/myarea\n\r\
Example : export area screen\n\r\
Example : export area email\n\r\
Example : export catalog mobs\n\r\
Example : export world data /exportfiles/\n\r\
Example : export player bob\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
The export command will generate the official coffeemud area files, \
whose extension is "*.cmare".  This command may also be used to export \
individual rooms, player data, or unique items or mobs as well.  If the second parameter \
(ITEMS/MOBS/WEAPONS/etc) is NOT specified, export will produce full \
room data for the scope of the first parameter (AREA, ROOM, or WORLD). \
If the second parameter IS specified, then only the specified data will \
be generated.\n\r\
The results will be written to the file given in the last argument, or to the \
screen if "screen" is given as the last argument, or sent to your email address \
if that is enabled.  The extension need not be \
included, as coffeemud will add it if not present.  If a directory name \
is given (no file name), the system will reference the AREA ARCHIVE file \
name for an Area, assuming EXPORT AREA or EXPORT WORLD is used. The default \
directory for this command is the CoffeeMud root.

ORDER=\
Command : ORDER\n\r\
Usage   : ORDER [TARGET NAME] [COMMAND(S)]\n\r\
Example : order dog flee\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command will allow you to force a mob to perform any command \
listed in the COMMANDS or SOCIALS list.
	
POOF=\
Command : POOF\n\r\
Usage   : POOF\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
For players with access to the GOTO command, this command will allow the admin to change \
the messages seen when they leave and enter a room via GOTO.  The S-NAME, S-HIM-HER and \
other codes may be used so that the admins name is properly presented.  Remember to \
surround the codes with the less-than and greater-than tag markers!

PURGE=\
Command : PURGE\n\r\
Usage   : PURGE [ITEM TYPE] ... \n\r\
Example : purge orc\n\r\
Example : purge item longsword\n\r\
Example : purge item longsword@an orc\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command is a weak form of DESTROY, allowing only items and mobs to be \
destroyed.  Rejuvinating mobs will still rejuvenate when purge is used, unlike \
destroy.
	
QUESTS=\
Command : QUESTS\n\r\
Usage   : QUESTS (WON/[QUEST NAME]/[PLAYER NAME])\n\r\
Example : quests\n\r\
Example : quests won\n\r\
Example : quests bob\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command is for listing quests one is either involved in, or \
were involved in. The admin version of this command allows a player \
name to be specified when retreiving information, or if the quest name \
is supplied, the winners of the quest.  Enter HELP QUESTS \
for more information on the mundane use of the command.

SNOOP=\
Command : SNOOP\n\r\
Usage   : SNOOP [TARGET NAME]\n\r\
Example : snoop player\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command will allow you to watch a player play -- seeing everything \
they type in, and everything they read on their screen.
	
STAT=\
Command : STAT\n\r\
Usage   : STAT ((SKILL/STAT TYPE) [TARGET NAME])/([NUMBER] [DAYS/WEEKS/MONTHS/YEARS]\n\r\

Example : stat chant hassan\n\r\
Example : stat prayer hassan\n\r\
Example : stat area midgaard\n\r\
Example : stat item my longsword\n\r\
Example : stat fountain\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command serves two purposes.  The first is to allow you to view \
a usage statistics report on your mud.  Entering STAT alone allows you \
to see information gathered since midnight.  You may also enter a number \
and a scale (days, weeks, months, or years) to view information going \
farther back.\n\r\
\n\r\
STAT will also allow you to retrieve basic stat information on a player, mob, \
item, room, or exit in the game.  Entering STAT and the objects name brings up the \
most basic information.  Specifying AREA, MOB, ITEM, ROOM, or EXIT before the name \
will make the search more specific. Including a skill type before a mob or player name \
will list their abilities of that type.  Valid skill types include: SKILL, \
SPELL, PRAYER, SONG, TRAP, PROPERTY, "THIEF SKILL", LANGUAGE, CHANT, \
"COMMON SKILL", DISEASE, POISON.  You can also get special reports by \
entering one of the following before the name: EQUIPMENT, COMBAT, INVENTORY, STINK, \
QUESTWINS, TATTOOS, TITLES, SCRIPTS, WORLDEXPLORED, AREASEXPLORED, ROOMSEXPLORED, \
FACTIONS, LEVELTIMES, and CHARSTATS.  As per the player version of this command, you can also use \
basic stats, such as: HITS, MANA, MOVE, HUNGER, THIRST, FATIGUE, MAXHITS, MAXMANA, MAXMOVE, \
MAXHUNGER, MAXTHIRST, MAXFATIGUE, STRENGTH, INTELLIGENCE, DEXTERITY, \
CONSTITUTION, CHARISMA, WISDOM, GENDER, PARALYSIS, FIRE, COLD, WATER, GAS, \
MIND, GENERAL, JUSTICE, ACID, ELECTRICITY, POISON, UNDEAD, MAGIC, DISEASE, \
TRAPS, MAXSTRENGTH, MAXINTELLIGENCE, MAXDEXTERITY, MAXCONSTITUTION, \
MAXCHARISMA, MAXWISDOM, AGE, DETECTION, CONVERSION, WEIGHTADJ, \
LEVEL, SENSES, ARMOR, DAMAGE, ATTACK, DISPOSITION, REJUV, WEIGHT, \
ABILITY, HEIGHT, XP (experience), XPFNL (experience for next level), and \
XPTNL (experience to next level), QUESTPOINTS, TRAINS, PRACTICES, and any \
factions shown in the score command, such as ALIGNMENT.

Usage   : PAUSE [ROOM/AREA/OBJECTNAME]\n\r\
Example : pause\n\r\
Example : pause area\n\r\
Example : pause orc\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This very powerful and dangerous command allows you to suspend all thread and \
ticking services in the entire mud.  It can be a quick and easy way to discern \
locked up threads, or to free up CPU time for other purposes.  Enter PAUSE alone \
to suspend and resume all objects, or specify room, area, or an object name \
to suspend the ticking of just that object.

SYSMSGS=\
Command : SYSMSGS\n\r\
Usage   : SYSMSGS\n\r\
Example : sysmsgs\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
A command to toggle debug mode, or extended messages.  A mobile NPC will not \
be able to enter or leave a room if a player in this mode is present.

AFTER=\

Usage   : AFTER (EVERY/STOP/LIST) [NUMBER] [SECONDS/TICKS/MINUTES/HOURS] [COMMAND]\n\r\
Example : after 5 seconds smile\n\r\
Example : after every 5 seconds at bob smile\n\r\
Example : after 10 minutes shutdown noprompt\n\r\
Example : after stop\n\r\
Example : after list\n\r\

may be used to make a command automatically recurring.  after stop should be \
used to cancel commands created with the every parameter.

TAKE=\
Command : TAKE\n\r\
Usage   : TAKE (ALL) [ITEM NAME] ([MOB NAME])\n\r\
Example : take all dagger Horice\n\r\
Example : take qp Horice\n\r\
Example : take all Horice\n\r\
Example : take pie Horice\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This is A command that forces the specified mob or character \
to give item that is in his or her inventory or equipment to \
you.  If the item is inside a specified container, it will \
be retrieved from the container.  The very special item name "qp" \
may be used to take Quest Points from players using this command. 

SHUTDOWN=\
Command : SHUTDOWN\n\r\
Usage   : SHUTDOWN (IN [NUMBER] [MINS/HOURS..]) (RESTART) (NOPROMPT) \n\r\
Example : shutdown\n\r\
Example : shutdown noprompt\n\r\
Example : shutdown in 10 minutes restart\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
With no argument, this command will bring down the CoffeeMud server. \
With the restart argument, it will "bounce" (restart) the server. \
You can also specify how long before the shutdown will begin.  This \
will also cause periodic warnings to your players.

UNLINK=\
Command : UNLINK\n\r\
Usage   : UNLINK [DIRECTION]\n\r\
Example : unlink north\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
A command for the unlinking of rooms from each other.

GMODIFY=\
Command : GMODIFY\n\r\
Usage   : GMODIFY (AREA/ROOM/WORLD) [FIELD=VAL](&&/||[...]) (CHANGE=[FIELD=VAL])\n\r\
Example : gmodify area class=genmob&&name=the cityguard change=name=the guard\n\r\
Example : gmodify world class=[cs]GenMob&&name=[ss]city change=name=[ss]\n\r\
Example : gmodify world class=[cs]GenItem&&name=a rusty sword change=destroy=true\n\r\
Example : gmodify ?\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
A command to select objects in a given area, room, or the whole world \
based on the specified field values, and optionally change some of \
those specified fields.\n\r\
\n\r\
Searching the entire world is implied, but the first parameter may be \
the word AREA or ROOM to narrow the search.  You may also enter WORLD \
to make the world search explicit.\n\r\
\n\r\
The next parameter is the search criteria.  \
The key phrase WHEN= may optionally precede it to \
make explicit that you are specifying the search criteria.  The search \
criteria fields may be separated by && strings to specify that all of the \
preceding criteria AND the next single criteria must be true.  The criteria \
fields may also be separated by || strings to specify that all of the preceding \
criteria OR the next single criteria may be true.  One of those strings must \
be present when specifying more than one criteria.\n\r\
\n\r\
Each field in the search criteria must be of the form FIELD=VALUE, FIELD!=VALUE, \
FIELD$VALUE, FIELD>VALUE, FIELD<VALUE, FIELD>=VALUE, or FIELD<=VALUE.  Where \
FIELD must be a valid search field.  Enter GMODIFY ? for a complete list of all \
valid fields.  Not all fields will apply to all object types, so take this into \
account especially when using < or != operators.  The operators are all normal \
except for the new one, $, which means that the value is really a regular expression. \
The VALUE portion of the criteria may be prefixed with modifiers, which include: \n\r\
[ss] to specify that the value refers to a substring of the fields whole value.\n\r\
[cs] to specify that the search is case sensitive (case insensitive is implied).\n\r\
\n\r\
The last parameter is the optional change specifications.  These specifications \
must be prefixed with the key phrase CHANGE=.  If these specifications are not \
included, GMODIFY will display the results of the search.  The change specifications \
are similar to the search criteria in that they consist of groupings of FIELD=VALUE \
separated by && strings.  Unlike search criteria, however, operators other than =, and \
strings other than || have no special meaning.  The fields, like in the search \
criteria, must be valid fields for the options selected by the search criteria.  A \
special field name "DESTROY", when set to true, will \
obliterate the item in question.  Otherwise, the ordinary \
fields on the object will be changed to the specified value UNLESS the following \
conditions are met: the VALUE portion of a field is prefixed with the modifier [ss], \
and the VALUE portion of an identical field in the search criteria was also prefixed with \
the modifier [ss].  Under those special conditions, instead of substituting the entire \
field value on the object with the new value, ONLY the portion of the string selected \
in the search criteria will be substituted.\n\r\
\n\r\
* Be very careful with this command! It is wise to try the command WITHOUT change= ... \
first, to make sure you are matching Exactly what you expect, before doing a change pass.

NOWIZINV=\
Command  : WIZARD INVISIBILITY\n\r\
Usage    : VISIBLE\n\r\
Example  : visible\n\r\
Short(s) : nowizinv\n\r\

Example  : goto hassan\n\r\
Example  : goto temple of mota\n\r\
Example  : goto midgaard\n\r\
Example  : goto previous\n\r\
Short(s) : \n\r\
The invoker and his or her followers will be transported, \
with very little fanfare, to the destination listed.  This \
ability is not magical in nature, and is thus not affected \
by no-teleport areas and rooms.  Appending an exclaimation \
point to the room will ADD fanfare to the entrance.

with very little fanfare, to the destination listed.  This \
ability is not magical in nature, and is thus not affected \
by no-teleport areas and rooms.  If all or item is used, it will refer \
only to those in the same room as the admin.  Otherwise, the \
admins present area will be checked for all instances of the name \
and transfers all of them.  If none are found in the same area, the \
whole world will be checked.  If the word items is used, then an item \
can also be transported to a room destination, though the word INVENTORY \
is also a valid destination to move the item into your inventory.

Usage   : TYPO [MESSAGE]/REVIEW (STARTING MSG)\n\r\
Example : typo nothing is spelled right in this room!\n\r\
Example : typo review\n\r\
Example : typo review 7\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This command can be used to submit typos to the system.  When \
the REVIEW parameter is given, the typos will be iterated through \
one at a time to give the archon a chance to delete, comment on, \
or email each one.  An optional starting number can be given to REVIEW.

SHELL=\
Command : SHELL\n\r\
Usage   : SHELL [COMMAND] [PARAMETERS]\n\r\
Example : shell\n\r\
Example : shell ?\n\r\
Example : shell directory\n\r\
Example : shell cd /resources/text\n\r\
Example : shell copy thisfile.txt ::\n\r\
Example : shell del ::thisfile.txt\n\r\
Example : shell edit thisfile.txt\n\r\
Short(s): .\n\r\
This command allows the archon, and users with appropriate FS: and/or VFS: security \
flags to access the file system and/or the virtual file system.  See help on CMFS \
or VFS for the difference between the two.\n\r\
\n\r\
The commands are case-insensitive, except where dealing with the local file system, where \
it may be case-sensitive depending upon the host system.  As mentioned in the CMFS docs, \
filenames and paths may be preceded by a :: string to denote forced VFS access, or // \
to denote forced local file-system access.  When neither is specified for a given \
shell command, the VFS file is always preferred. The / character is always used to separate \
directory paths and folders, such as /resources/text/down.txt would refer to the file \
down.txt in the text folder, which in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is \
located in the root directory.\n\r\
\n\r\
The shell command may be entered with no parameter to see the players current directory. \
When viewing directories, a "-" character will precede a file which exists only in the \
VFS system.  A "+" character will precede a file which exists in both the local file \
system and the VFS system.  Since folders always exist in the VFS, they will always \
be seen with the "+" character preceding them.\n\r\
\n\r\
The shell command can be used to create directories, delete files or directories, \
copy files, search for files with given names, search inside text files for a \
text string, display a text file, or edit a text file.  Many commands support a \
mask to limit the files displayed. The mask may include "*" characters anywhere \
in the string to match 0 or more unknown characters in the filenames.  A "?" \
character always matches a single unknown character in a filename. \n\r\
\n\r\

MASKS=\
In numerous parameters, places, and input fields, CoffeeMud will ask you for something \
called a "Zapper Mask".  The mask is used to help select particular mobs, items, etc \
from the universe of available selections by "filtering out" those you don't want. \
For example, if you wanted to only select mobs named Bob, you would compose a mask \
that Disallows non-mobs, and Disallows things that dont have the name Bob.  This is \
done using the Zapper Mask syntax, shown below:\n\r\
<ZAP=disallow>

ZAPPER_MASKS=MASKS

ABILITY_PREREQS=\
Ability Prerequisites is a comma delimited list of skills or skill masks that describe \
what skills or set of skills must be learned, and at what optional proficiency, before \
a player of a given class can learn that skill.  The list is comma delimited, and each \
item in the list consists of a valid Ability ID (like Spell_Fireball), or a wildcard \
mask of Ability_IDs (like Spell_F* to select all Ability IDs beginning with Spell_F). \
Following the Ability_ID is an optionally number in parenthesis, which would represent \
the minimum proficiency of the aforementioned Ability that is required.\n\r\
Example:\n\r\
Skill_Trip(50),Fighter_*(10)\n\r\
The above means that the current ability requires that the player have Trip at 50% \
proficiency and any Fighter skill at 10% proficiency or better.
