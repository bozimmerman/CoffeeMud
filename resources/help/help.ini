Example : auction channel the ring is really great!\n\r\
Example : auction close\n\r\
Example : auction list\n\r\
Example : auction info\n\r\
Short(s): \n\r\
This versatile command is used by players wishing to auction items \
at real time over the AUCTION channel, as well as by those wishing \
to bid on items up for auction.  To \
start an auction, the player enters AUCTION UP plus the name of the \
item, and an optional starting bid.  If there is no other auction \
going on at the time, the auction will begin.  Auctions last for a \
silent 5 minutes, plus 1 minute for each going once/twice/sold.  \
If no bids have been received after the first 3 minutes, the item \
will proceed directly to the going once/twice/sold period. \
The person putting on the auction may, at any time, close the auction \
without penalty by entering "auction close", or communicate on the \
auction channel (to give a better item description perhaps) using \
"auction channel [message]".\n\r\
\n\r\
To place a bid on an auction that is ongoing, a player need only \
enter "auction bid [amount]".  Where amount is the maximum amount the \
player will pay for the item.  A proxy bidding system is in place \
for all auctions.  The current bid on the item will always be less \
than or equal to the bid of the high bidder, and at least 1 gold more \
than the bid of the previous high bidder.  This means that, if the \
current bid on an item is 5, and a player bids 10, the new bid will \
become 6 (one more than the previous high bid).  If another player then \
bids 20, the new bid will become 11.\n\r\
\n\r\
Players can also get information on a live auction while it is going on \
by entering AUCTION INFO or AUCTION LIST.\n\r\
\n\r\
When an auction ends, the system will attempt to automatically complete \
the transaction for both the bidder and the auctioneer.  The proper money \
will be transferred (in converted notes) from the high bidder to the \
auctioneer.  The item up for auction will be automatically transferred \
from the auctioneer to the high bidder.  The auction house may take a \
cut both when then auction is placed up, and on the final price. \n\r\

archers and mages with ranged spells in battle.  The range of the group members in \
formation, with respect to enemies, is always relative to the initial range of the lead \
player in combat.  That is to say, if a group member is set to be at row #1, and \
the leader uses a bow to start off at range 3, then that group member will be at \
row #4 instead (1 off from the leaders position).  \n\r\
