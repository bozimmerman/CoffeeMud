This skill allows a player to craft master-level weapons (levels 31-60) from metal.  This \
skill requires Blacksmithing and Weaponsmithing in order to learn it.  It also requires \
specialization in the weapon type the player wishes to make.  The extent of \
the weapons which can be crafted expands as the player goes up in \
level.  To begin smithing, the player must be in a room with an \
open fire burning, and must have placed the metal he or she wishes \
to make the weapon from on the ground.  The player may also scan the \
room or other players for equipment that may be mended by this skill, \

item he or she has found, provided a blank recipe page \
or a recipe book with blank pages is in his or her inventory. \
The metal for weaponsmithing is obtained using the Mining skill, or \

increase both the strength and the required level of the crafted item, \
and some material types require smaller amounts to make the same items.

Example  : mcure carp\n\r\
With this skill, a player can carefully apply spices in an attempt to cure some \
amount of meat to prevent it from spoiling.  The amount of time this takes will \
depend on the amount of meat being cured in a targeted bundle.  If successful, \
the meat bundle will never spoil.  If not successful, the meat will seem cured for \
a time, but will eventually stop seeming cured, and then eventually spoil.

the player, being known only as "mushrooms".  With this skill, the player \
may identify an mushroom for the type that it is.  This skill is quite \
necessary for Cooks and Assassins who need particular mushrooms for \
recipes, but is fairly unnecessary for others. \
The raw mushrooms for mycology are obtained by using the Foraging skill.

in a room which can nevertheless be LOOKed at. \n\r\
\n\r\

Example  : playinstrument\n\r\
This skill allows a player to attempt to play a musical instrument they are holding or \

percentage of the publishing price every time it is purchased. \n\r\

or exact phrase appears in a group of applicable written works, which includes \
recipes, books, journals, and paper.  The books can be recalled if the works \
and player are both in the same room, which the player owns, or if the works \
in the room with the player were created by the player, or if the works are in \
the players inventory.

RODSMITH=RODSMITHING
RODSMITHING=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : RODSMITH (LIST/INFO/MEND/SCAN/LEARN) [ROD NAME]\n\r\

room or other players for equipment that may be mended by this skill, \
using the scan parameter, or learn how to make a found item, provided \
a blank recipe page, or recipe book with blank pages is in his or her inventory. \
The metal for rodsmithing is obtained using the Blacksmith skill and/or Smelting skills, though some \
recipes will require additional material obtained by other means.  When the player \

will simply appear in the fields.  \
You can also bundle multiple funguses together using this skill.  The GET command \
can be used to unbundle such resources.  See also the Composting skill.
