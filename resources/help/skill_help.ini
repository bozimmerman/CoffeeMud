the food and water, they will eat and drink as necessary from what they have \

Usage    : MASTSHOT [WEAPON NAME]\n\r\
Example  : mastshot catapult\n\r\
The pirate can aim a siege weapon at the currently targeted ship`s \
masts instead of the hull.  If the weapon hits the ship, there is a \
10% chance (improved by expertise) that it will also hit the mast, \
and slow the ships movement speed by one.  This effect is cumulative, \
so that subsequent hits will slow the ship further.  Either way, a \
weapon so aimed will never do hull damage unless it hits a mast.  This \
skill must be used to re-aim the siege weapon every combat round.

through in the case of entryways, or entering in the case \
of rooms.  The thief who sets the trap may not trigger the \
trap. The number of traps available to the thief will go \
up as the thief advances in level, so trap list may be used \
to see what new traps are available as the thief advances.  \
Not all traps may be set on all items, however.  Lay Minor \
traps only allows a small subset of the traps avaiailable from \
the full Lay Traps skill. Traps are temporary, but reset if \

of rooms.  The thief who sets the trap may not trigger the \
trap.  The number of traps available to the thief will go \
up as the thief advances in level, so trap list may be used \
to see what new traps are available as the thief advances.  \

LISTEN=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : LISTEN [DIRECTION NAME]\n\r\
Example  : listen north\n\r\
Example  : listen\n\r\

A very proficient thief may also tell the number of creatures, and may \
be able to listen in on private conversations and whispering that may \
be going on in the room.  You may only listen to the room you are in, \
or to an adjacent indoor room.  How well the thief can hear will depend \
on proficiency, how much higher in level than the thief those being \
listened to are, and alertness expertise.

LOCATE_ALCOHOL=THIEF_LOCATEALCOHOL
THIEF_LOCATE_ALCOHOL=THIEF_LOCATEALCOHOL
THIEF_LOCATEALCOHOL=<ABILITY>\

The thief attempts to make some sort of bomb from the \

may be of any of the listed sort.  The thief who \
makes the bomb may activate it by HOLDING the item. \
Once the item is held, the thief has but a few seconds \
to drop, throw, or do whatever they need to before the \
bomb goes off.  The number of bombs available to the thief will go \
up as the thief advances in level, so bomb list may be used \
to see what new bombs are available as the thief advances.  \
Not all bombs may be set on all items, however.

SKILL_MAP=MAKE_MAPS
MAP=MAKE_MAPS
MAKE_MAPS=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : MAP [PAPER NAME]\n\r\

Usage    : MARK [TARGET NAME]\n\r\
Example  : mark orc\n\r\
The player marks the target for death.  Once done, the player will \
remember who they have marked until the death of the mark is witnessed, or \
the mark is changed.  The ability of the player to kill the mark will go \
up the longer the player has to "observe" the mark.  The mark is observed \
whenever the player is in the same room as the mark and can see him, but \
the mark cannot see the player.  Marking for death is also useful for \
certain higher level assassin skills.  You can issue a Mark a second time \
against the same target to remove the mark.

SKILL_MARKDISGUISE=MARK_DISGUISE
MARKDISGUISE=MARK_DISGUISE
MARK_DISGUISE=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : MARKDISGUISE (!)\n\r\
Example  : markdisguise\n\r\
Example  : markdisguise !\n\r\
This powerful ability allows the bard to disguise him or herself to be \
identical to his or her mark.  The bard must first mark a target using \
the Mark skill.  After that, the bard must observe the mark from a hidden \
position for an amount of time.  After sufficient time, the bard may use \
this skill to take on the apperance of the mark through disguise.  Entering \
the command word again will remove the disguise.  The optional ! parameter \
may be given for the bard to disguise him or herself as the same person they \
did before, regardless of whether they are presently marked.

THIEF_MARKTRAPPED=MARK_TRAPPED
MARKTRAPPED=MARK_TRAPPED
MARK_TRAPPED=<ABILITY>\

Example  : marktrapped north\n\r\
Example  : marktrapped chest\n\r\
The thief places an easily recognizable marker upon the target which all will \
recognize as meaning that it is trapped.  This can serve as a nice warning to \
team members that stumble that way, or a confusing countermeasure to force \
other thieves to be extra careful.  The skill can be used again to remove \
such marks.  Marks last quite a long time, though each thief is limited \
in the number that may be marked.

THIEF_MARKERSPYING=MARKER_SPYING

MARKER_SPYING=<ABILITY>\

his marks.  Until this skill is disengaged, he will remember \
those parts of the papers of those he Marks that the marks \
themselves read, regardless of where they are in the world. \n\r\
\n\r\
This skill is identical to SPYING, but does not require that \
the thief and the one spied on be in the same room, and it \
only works on those the thief has MARKed.  The skill \
automatically transfers from Mark to Mark indefinitely, or \
until disengaged.

SKILL_MEDITATION=MEDITATION
MEDITATE=MEDITATION
MEDITATION=<ABILITY>\

By spending the necessary practice points or trains, a Mage may use this command \
to gain the ability to learn some spell that is written \
on a scroll.  If the memorization is successful, the spell may \
be practiced and cast as normal, and the mage will gain \
experience based on the level of himself and the spell learned.

ship.  This makes the ship unattackable by all except another pirate who knows \
the merchant flag trick.  Once the ship enters combat, the merchant flag goes \
down, and the pirate flag back up.  This makes the ship so notorious that it \
can not fool anyone with the merchant flag for another mud-month.

SKILL_MIMICRY=MIMICRY
MIMICRY=<ABILITY>\
Usage    : MIMICRY [TARGET NAME]\n\r\
Example  : mimcry orc\n\r\

is relieved of any hunger.

through druidic magic.  This ability allows the druid to perceive all of his \
or her magical plants still alive, and where they are.\n\r\
\n\r\
This skill is most useful for Plant Pass and for creating a druidic connection \
to an area.  A druid in a rural area has placed one of his or her plants in \
at least 50% of the rooms in an area will create a druidic connection to the area. \
See also Druidic Connection for more information on this phenomenon.\n\r\
\n\r\
