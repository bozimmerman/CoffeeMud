Parameters : (RESPECTFOLLOW=true/false)\n\r\
Example    : once=false areaok=true minticks=10 maxticks=20\n\r\
Description: \n\r\
By default, as soon as a mob with this ability finds himself able to move, and no longer in combat, \
and not following anyone, and the room clear of PCs, he will wander back to his start room until he \
finds himself, once again, far from home.\n\r\
\n\r\
The default behavior can be modified with parameters.  AREAOK will allow the mob to wander, so long as \
he stays in his home area, only returning home if he finds himself outside his area.  IGNOREPCS will \
allow the mob to wander home even if other PCs are in the room watching him.  IGNOREFOLLOW will \
allow the mob to wander home even if he is following someone, magically or otherwise.  RESPECTFOLLOW will \
immediately negate this property if the mob is ever following anyone. ONCE will \
make this property work only one time, deleting itself after the mob has gone home. MINTICKS and MAXTICKS \
set a limit on how long the mob can be away from home before considering a return trip; by default, MINTICKS \
and MAXTICKS are 0, meaning the mob is constantly trying to get home.

modified from the MUDGrinder Control Panel or the coffeemud.ini file.  It \
is a special kind of journal that users can write to from the command line \
with the command journal command word, such as BUG, or IDEA, or TYPO.  The \
Command Journal's entries can then be listed by those with the necessary \
security clearance by using the LIST [JOURNALNAME] command.  Entries can \
also be stepped through using the command [JOURNALNAME] REVIEW ([MSG NUMBER]) \
syntax.  They can be transferred from the step-through menu to other journals, \
or they can be transferred directly from the command line with \
[JOURNALNAME] TRANSFER [MSG NUMBER] [2ND_JOURNALNAME]. Lastly, entries in a \
command journal can be deleted from the step-through menu, or by entering \
DESTROY [JOURNALNAME] [MSG NUMBER].

Example    : multiwatch add playerone playertwo\n\r\
Example    : multiwatch auto\n\r\
Example    : multiwatch stop\n\r\
Description: \n\r\
This is an archon skill to assist in determining if a set of players who \
are connected from the same ip address are the same person.  It does \
this by tracking certain pieces of data which together may be taken \
as rather circumstantial evidence of someone multiplaying.  The definition \
of the numbers are as follows:\n\r\
SYNC - The number of commands entered by more than one member of an IP group \
within a single 4 second period. \n\r\
SPEECH - This refers to SAY commands, broken into three sections.  The \
first number represents the number of SAY commands done in the same room \
with a player who has the same IP address.  The second number represents \
the number of SAY commands directed at another player.  The last number \
is the number of SAY commands total.\n\r\
SOCIALS - These are also divided into three numbers where, again, the \
first is the number of socials in the same room with a player with the \
same IP, the second being socials directed at another player, and the \
last being the number of total socials.\n\r\
CMD - The number of commands entered which are different than the previous \
command entered.\n\r\
ORDER - The number of times one of the players in the group gave an ORDER \
to another player in the group.  A sure sign indeed.

Parameters : [XML Document]\n\r\
Example    : <VARNAME>my value</VARNAME>\n\r\
Description: \n\r\
An internal use property for attaching random keypair data to any Modifiable and Generic object.

MQL=\
MQL Stands for MUD Query Language.  It's purpose is to allow the Archon, or a random quest xml document, \
to select existing objects in the game, or the properties of existing objects.  \n\r\
\n\r\
The structure of MQL is similar to SQL in that all MQL statements are of this structure:\n\r\
\n\r\
SELECT: [property, property, ..] FROM [object set]  WHERE [object comparison, object comparison]\n\r\
* note the colon : after the word SELECT above.\n\r\
\n\r\
The SELECT clause defines the properties you wish to be returned from the MQL statement.\n\r\
The FROM clause defines the set of objects that you might want to return the properties of.\n\r\
The WHERE clause defines the conditions under which any member of the set in the FROM clause may be included in the final results.\n\r\
\n\r\
A FROM clause can be a simple world set term, such as one of the following:\n\r\
\n\r\
    * A CMFS file path to a CMARE file, such as ::/resources/map/plains.cmare\n\r\
    * AREAS to use the set of all world areas\n\r\
    * ROOMS to use the set of all existing world rooms\n\r\
    * MOBS to use the set of all existing world mobs\n\r\
    * ITEMS to use the set of all existing world items\n\r\
    * In case where a qualifying object is implied, AREA can be used to refer to that specific area.\n\r\
    * Another SELECT: statement in parenthesis, such as: SELECT: name from (SELECT * from AREA)\n\r\
\n\r\
The FROM clause can also include narrowing suffixes.  A narrowing suffix comes after the simple term, and is \
separated from it by a backslash \\.   For example, if your from clause looks like SELECT * FROM AREAS\\ROOM  , \
then the ROOM portion is the narrowing suffix of the AREAS term.  You can also continue adding more narrowing \
suffixes as needed.  For example: SELECT * FROM AREAS\\MOBS\\EQUIPMENT  .  Each suffix narrows or alters the term \
immediate before it, and the entire FROM clause will end up reflecting the type of object described by the final \
term, whether it be simple, or a narrowing term.\n\r\
\n\r\
The following are useful narrowing terms:\n\r\
\n\r\
    * AREAS to use the unique set of areas in which the prior term is located\n\r\
    * ROOMS to use the unique set of rooms in which the prior term is located, or which the prior term contains\n\r\
    * MOBS, MOB to use the set of all mobs contained in the prior term\n\r\
    * ITEMS, ITEM to use the set of all items contained in the prior term\n\r\
    * OWNER to use the set of all item owners of the prior term, if it was items\n\r\
    * EQUIPMENT to use the set of all  worn items of the prior term\n\r\
\n\r\
Be careful when using narrowing terms to make sure they make sense for the term prior to them.  For example, if \
importing mobs from a cmare file, AREAS will not likely resolve to anything, since the mobs aren't in the world yet.\n\r\
\n\r\
The SELECT: clause can include one or more comma-delimited properties of  the objects in the from clause, or it can \
be an asterisk *, or a period ., to refer simply to the from objects themselves.  It can also be a string or numeric \
literal, or an XML tag when embedding MQL in a random quest document.    Different kinds of objects have different \
kinds of properties, so it is tricky to define precisely what a legal and illegal object property might be.  Choosing \
incorrectly will usually just result in an empty string "".\n\r\
\n\r\
An example of a legal property might be the property CLASS, since it applies to everything from areas and rooms, to \
mobs, and items.  NAME is also a property that almost all objects have.  Beyond this. using the GMODIFY command might \
be the simplest way to get a list of valid properties for a specific type of world object, or objects imported from cmare files.\n\r\
\n\r\
As mentioned previously, SELECT: clause properties can be separated by commas in order to select more than one.  For \
example: SELECT: class, name FROM areas\\mobs would show the class id and name of every mob in your game.\n\r\
\n\r\
SELECT: clauses can also include an AS qualifier for each property selected.  This has only the effect of \
changing the apparent name of the property for other parts of the system.  For an example using the WHERE \
command to issue MQL: WHERE AREA SELECT: class as classid, name as mob_name FROM areas\\mobs would show the \
same results as the previous example statement, but with different name tags for the class and name properties.  \
This might be important when using an embedded SELECT: statement as your FROM clause, since you can only select \
properties that the embedded clause has returned, by the names they were given.\n\r\
\n\r\
SELECT: clauses, similar to FROM clauses above, can include narrowing terms.  Like FROM clauses, these narrowing terms are separated by backslashes \\.   \
SELECT clauses, at the moment, only support one narrowing term: COUNT.  The purpose of the COUNT term is to report the number of times the value of \
the previous terms appears in the rest of the FROM: clause.  For example, suppose you wanted to know the number of times each mob name is used, \
to do that, you might enter SELECT: name, name\\count FROM areas\\mobs\n\r\
\n\r\
Lastly, SELECT: clause can contain aggregating prefixes before a property term, which will transform the \
final result set in some way by aggregating the rows according to the prefix.  Prefixes, like suffixes, are \
separated from the property term by a backslash \\.  The value aggregating prefixes are:\n\r\
\n\r\
    * MEDIAN to return only the median value of all the property terms in the existing result set\n\r\
    * MEAN to return the mean value of all the property terms in the existing result set\n\r\
    * COUNT to return the count of the number of  items in the result set\n\r\
    * UNIQUE to include only one row where the property is of any given value\n\r\
\n\r\
For example, to quickly count the mobs in your game, you might enter SELECT: COUNT\\* from AREAS\\MOBS\n\r\
\n\r\
The WHERE clause contains one or more conditions, which you can further compare using connectors like AND, \
OR, or parenthesis to group conditions together.  Each condition consists of  two terms separated by a \
comparator.  Value comparitors include = (equal to), <> (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), \
>= (greater or equal), <= (less or equal), IN (in a set or object group, or a substring of), or LIKE \
(matching a ZAPPERMASK).\n\r\
\n\r\
A condition consists of two property terms, similar to those described in the SELECT: clause above, \
except that condition terms can not use aggregating prefixes.  Narrowing suffixes, however, are \
permitted.  For example NAME = 'Bob' is checking whether the NAME property of an item in the FROM \
clause is equal to the string literal "BOB".  If it is, when that condition is true.  Putting it \
together then, to show the mobs in your game whose names are EXACTLY "BOB", you might do SELECT: * \
FROM areas\\mobs WHERE name="BOB". This works because NAME is a property of every mob in the AREAS\\MOBS \
from set, and can be compared with the word "BOB".\n\r\
\n\r\
Condition statements are grouped together into conditions using AND or OR.  For example, changing the \
above condition to WHERE name="BOB" OR name="JOE" would expand the number of possible results by one name.

PRESENCEREACTION=\
Ability    : PresenceReaction\n\r\
Parameters : =[MOB/PLAYERNAME]\n\r\
Parameters : (=[MOB/PLAYERNAME]~~)([COMMAND]=[PARMS]~~)[...]\n\r\
Parameters : +[COMMAND]=[PARMS]\n\r\
Example    : =warriorbob~~mood=happy~~aggressive=~~mudchat=elf~~\n\r\
Description: \n\r\
This temporary property governs temporary reactions in the form of behaviors, \
properties, standard commands, or other effects.  These reactions \
persist only so long as the mob/player the property was invoked against \
remains in the same room as the invoker.  Intended as an tool for the faction \
system, this property can be invoked as a skill against the target, or used in \
other ways.  The parameters are a ~~ delimited list of ability, behavior, or \
command names followed by an = sign and any parameters.  If the ability name \
is empty, then it is assumed you are designating the mob or player being \
reacted to.  As it is required to designate a mob being reacted to, this must \
be eventually set either by parameters, or through invoking.\n\r\
\n\r\
This affect automatically removes itself and its subordinate effects whenever \
the reacted to player/mob is not in the same room as the invoking mob.

REGENERATION=\

even during combat.  Hit point damage will remain permanent (not \
regenerate) if the damage is done by a weapon type specified in the \
parameters.  Valid weapon types include the standard weapon types \
(bashing, piercing, slashing, gassing, bursting, etc), magic to refer \
to spells and magical weapons, weapon materials (silver, cotton, etc), \
or a minimum weapon level specifier as shown above.

SECURITY=\
SECURITY in CoffeeMud is on a player by player basis.  \n\r\
SYSOP status is defined as the ultimate security to do \
anything, anywhere, at any time.  Access to all commands in all areas will \
be available.  SYSOP status is defined in the CoffeeMud ini file entry SYSOPMASK \
which establishes the player characteristics that designate SYSOPS. \
All players who meet the requirements of the mask are automatically \
SYSOPS.\n\r\
\n\r\
Players who are not SYSOPS may also be granted specific privileges.  Each \
of the privileges may be limited to specific areas, or available globally. \
Privileges are defined in the Security section of a players settings.  Each \
security code listed for a player may be either a list of security Groups, or \
a specific security code.\n\r\
\n\r\
Security GROUPS are also defined in the ini file.  A Security GROUP \
consists of a group name, and a set of strings or codes representing privileges for \
that group.  Each group is prefixed in the INI file with the "GROUP_".  However, \
you should not use the "GROUP_" when adding group priviledges to the Security \
field of a player.  For instance, if you have "GROUP_BUILDER" defined in the \
INI file, then you would add "BUILDER" to Security when modifying a player in \
order to make that user part of the BUILDER group.  The security codes which make \
up each group are implicitly global, but can be qualified as area-only using the \
keyword "AREA".\n\r\
\n\r\
The following are the default strings or codes which, when found in a players \
security settings or in a group definition, confer the listed privileges. \
Each of these settings may be entered as listed below, or prefixed with the \
word "AREA" followed by a space, followed by the key.  This has the effect of \
making that privilege only available in or at areas where the Player is listed \
in the areas "Staff" setting.  For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" by itself \
confers the global ability to use the ANNOUNCE command.  The security code \
"AREA ANNOUNCE" means that the ANNOUNCE command can only be used inside areas \
where the player is listed as Staff.\n\r\

VFS=VFS Refers specifically to those files in the CMFS (CoffeeMud File System) which are stored \
in your database, as opposed to directly in your local file system (hard drive).  VFS files are \
also mentioned to distinguish between local files, although VFS files appear to CoffeeMud to be \
right along side, or even on top of, your local files in your local directories.  VFS can even \
include its own directories which are not in your local file system.  See HELP CMFS for more \
information on this topic. 

VFS_FILE=VFS
LOCAL_FILE=CMFS
FILE_SYSTEM=CMFS
FS=CMFS
PVP=PLAYERKILL
PLAYERVERSUSPLAYER=PLAYERKILL

HOLIDAYS=Holidays are a special/reserved quest defined by file /resources/quests/holidays/holidays.quest. \
They are very simple Scriptless quests that can be started at random intervals, or on certain mud dates, or \
real-life dates.  The holidays will only impact the areas specified by the holiday settings, and only the mobs \
in those areas specified in the settings, and only with the features you specify.  Use LIST HOLIDAYS to see a \
list of all defined holidays and the areas hey are defined for.  By default, 3 special-case weather related \
holidays are included which impact any area that meets their criteria.  You can use MODIFY HOLIDAY <name> to \
change the settings for a holiday, DESTROY HOLIDAY <name> to delete one, or CREATE HOLIDAY name to create a new \
one that will automatically apply to the area the creator is standing in.

CMFS=CoffeeMud File System\n\r\
The CoffeeMud File System is a means of accessing files inside your main CoffeeMud folder along side \
files stored in your CoffeeMud database.  Files in the CMFS can be stored either \
in the local file system, in CoffeeMud's database, or in both.  The CMFS sees both sets of files \
and folders/directories as if they were part of a single file system.\n\r\
\n\r\
Normally, the files required for operation of CoffeeMud, such as text files, \
class files, help files, images, and other files, are loaded from the appropriate \
directories on your LOCAL file system inside the main CoffeeMud folder.  If you \
installed CoffeeMud into D:\\games\\engines\\coff, for instance, the file intro.txt \
(the intro screen) would be loaded from D\:\\games\\engines\\coff\\\ resources\\text\\intro.txt. \n\r\
\n\r\
Under the CoffeeMud system, however, you should always think of your CoffeeMud folder as a \
file system unto itself.  The same file discussed above, even when referring to the local \
file system inside CoffeeMud, would be accessed using the path:  resources/text/intro.txt. \
You'll notice that the path separators are forward slashes / like in UNIX, instead of the \
normal back-slashes \\ used in DOS.  This is the standard for the CMFS.  You'll \
also notice that the resources directory is accessed as if it were at the root of its own \
drive.  This is also part of the CoffeeMud File System.  Because of this, CoffeeMud is \
utterly unable to access any files outside of its installation directory.  Keep this in mind!\n\r\
\n\r\
Within this installation directory structure, CoffeeMud is able to store files both on your \
local file system drive, and in your database (VFS Files).  The VFS, or Virtual File System, \
refers specifically to files and folders \
which are saved in your database, and accessible through the MUDGrinder's File Browser, \
or the MUD's SHELL command (see HELP SHELL).  When the CoffeeMud directory structure is \
viewed through those two screens, files in the CoffeeMud database and files in the local \
file system are both viewable as if they were part of a single file system, the CMFS.\n\r\
\n\r\
The files referenced in CoffeeMud are case-insensitive, except where dealing with the \
local file system, where it may be case-sensitive depending upon your operating system.  \
Any filename or path may be preceded by a :: string to denote \
forced VFS/database access, or // to denote forced local file-system access.  When neither is \
specified for a given file path, the VFS file is always preferred over the local one. \
For instance, the path ::resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY to a copy of the intro.txt \
file stored in the database as a VFS file. If that file is not in the database when the :: \
string is used, the file will not be found.  The path //resources/text/intro.txt would refer \
ONLY to the copy of the intro.txt file stored in the local file system, even if the same file \
appears in the VFS.  The path resources/text/intro.txt will use the copy of intro.txt stored in \
the VFS *if* it exists there, or the one on the local file system otherwise.\n\r\
\n\r\
The / character is always used to separate directory paths and folders, such as \
/resources/text/intro.txt would refer to the file down.txt in the text folder, which \
in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is located in the root directory.\n\r\
\n\r\
So, as we've seen, whenever you need to refer to a file in CoffeeMud, you should keep this system \
in mind.  Files which are part of your CMFS may be in the VFS database, or in the local file \
system.  They may even be in both! \
This system provides security for the server in which CoffeeMud is being run, and provides for the \
ability to grant folder-level (or even VFS-folder-level) security to builders and other administrative \
users.

MATH_EXPRESSION=MATH_FORMULA
EXPRESSION=MATH_FORMULA
FORMULA=MATH_FORMULA
MATH_FORMULA=\
In certain fields and specifications, CoffeeMud will allow you to enter a mathematical formula in \
place of a simple number in order to calculate a number at run-time.  This is useful for occasions \
where you want the number to have a random element, or where the value of the number is calculated \
based on certain variables only available at run-time.\n\r\
\n\r\
The formulas can be anything from a simple number, to numbers combined with mathematical operators \
+ - \\ *, grouped with parenthesis ( ), and may also include certain special operators.\n\r\
\n\r\
One special operator, ? , is for generating a random number (ex: 2?5 refers to a random number \
between 2 and 5).  Another special operator, >, is for bounding the result of an operation \
(ex: 5 * 10 > 10 will evaluate to the greater of 10 or 5 * 10.  The < operator does the opposite.
