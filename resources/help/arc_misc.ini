first is the number of socials in the same room with a player with the \
same IP, the second being socials directed at another player, and the \
last being the number of total socials.\n\r\

SECURITY=\
SECURITY in CoffeeMud is on a player by player basis.  \n\r\
SYSOP status is defined as the ultimate security to do \
anything, anywhere, at any time.  Access to all commands in all areas will \
be available.  SYSOP status is defined in the CoffeeMud ini file entry SYSOPMASK \
which establishes the player characteristics that designate SYSOPS. \
All players who meet the requirements of the mask are automatically \
SYSOPS.\n\r\
\n\r\
Players who are not SYSOPS may also be granted specific privileges.  Each \
of the privileges may be limited to specific areas, or available globally. \
Privileges are defined in the Security section of a players settings.  Each \
security code listed for a player may be either a list of security Groups, or \
a specific security code.\n\r\
\n\r\
Security GROUPS are also defined in the ini file.  A Security GROUP \
consists of a group name, and a set of strings or codes representing privileges for \
that group.  Each group is prefixed in the INI file with the "GROUP_".  However, \
you should not use the "GROUP_" when adding group priviledges to the Security \
field of a player.  For instance, if you have "GROUP_BUILDER" defined in the \
INI file, then you would add "BUILDER" to Security when modifying a player in \
order to make that user part of the BUILDER group.  The security codes which make \
up each group are implicitly global, but can be qualified as area-only using the \
keyword "AREA".\n\r\
\n\r\
The following are the default strings or codes which, when found in a players \
security settings or in a group definition, confer the listed privileges. \
Each of these settings may be entered as listed below, or prefixed with the \
word "AREA" followed by a space, followed by the key.  This has the effect of \
making that privilege only available in or at areas where the Player is listed \
in the areas "Staff" setting.  For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" by itself \
confers the global ability to use the ANNOUNCE command.  The security code \
"AREA ANNOUNCE" means that the ANNOUNCE command can only be used inside areas \
where the player is listed as Staff.\n\r\

TASKS=The ability to ADD, LIST and DESTROY entries in the TASKS list.\n\r\
TICKTOCK=The ability to use the command of the same name.\n\r\
TRAILTO=The ability to use the command of the same name.\n\r\
TRANSFER=The ability to use the command of the same name.\n\r\
VFS: <path>=The ability to read/write files in the vfs path given. No preceding / chars! \n\r\
WHERE=The ability to use the command of the same name.\n\r\
WIZINV=The ability to use the command of the same name, as well as see those who are WIZINV.\n\r\
\n\r\
Here is an example Security setting for a player:\n\r\
Security: BUILDER, AREA GOTO, SNOOP, VFS: RESOURCES/TEXT/ \n\r\
The above would give a player access to the BUILDER group defined by GROUP_BUILDER in your \
INI file.  It would also give access to the GOTO command, but only insofar as it relates \
to areas where the player is listed as Staff.  Lastly, it gives global access to the Snoop \
command.

VFS=VFS Refers specifically to those files in the CMFS (CoffeeMud File System) which are stored \
in your database, as opposed to directly in your local file system (hard drive).  VFS files are \
also mentioned to distinguish between local files, although VFS files appear to CoffeeMud to be \
right along side, or even on top of, your local files in your local directories.  VFS can even \
include its own directories which are not in your local file system.  See HELP CMFS for more \
information on this topic.

HOLIDAYS=Holidays are a special/reserved quest defined by file /resources/quests/holidays/holidays.quest. \
They are very simple Scriptless quests that can be started at random intervals, or on certain mud dates, or \
real-life dates.  The holidays will only impact the areas specified by the holiday settings, and only the mobs \
in those areas specified in the settings, and only with the features you specify.  Use LIST HOLIDAYS to see a \
list of all defined holidays and the areas hey are defined for.  By default, 3 special-case weather related \
holidays are included which impact any area that meets their criteria.  You can use MODIFY HOLIDAY <name> to \
change the settings for a holiday, DESTROY HOLIDAY <name> to delete one, or CREATE HOLIDAY name to create a new \
one that will automatically apply to the area the creator is standing in.

INJURIES=INJURY
INJURY=If you are hit in combat, you may receive damage to one or more limbs or body parts.  \
Once combat is over, your damaged parts will begin to heal at the same rate as your hit \
points are re-gained.  However, should a limb or body part become damaged 100% during \
combat, you will lose the use of that limb or body part, so be careful!

CMFS=CoffeeMud File System\n\r\
The CoffeeMud File System is a means of accessing files inside your main CoffeeMud folder along side \
files stored in your CoffeeMud database.  Files in the CMFS can be stored either \
in the local file system, in CoffeeMud's database, or in both.  The CMFS sees both sets of files \
and folders/directories as if they were part of a single file system.\n\r\
\n\r\
Normally, the files required for operation of CoffeeMud, such as text files, \
class files, help files, images, and other files, are loaded from the appropriate \
directories on your LOCAL file system inside the main CoffeeMud folder.  If you \
installed CoffeeMud into D:\\games\\engines\\coff, for instance, the file intro.txt \
(the intro screen) would be loaded from D\:\\games\\engines\\coff\\\ resources\\text\\intro.txt. \n\r\
\n\r\
Under the CoffeeMud system, however, you should always think of your CoffeeMud folder as a \
file system unto itself.  The same file discussed above, even when referring to the local \
file system inside CoffeeMud, would be accessed using the path:  resources/text/intro.txt. \
You'll notice that the path separators are forward slashes / like in UNIX, instead of the \
normal back-slashes \\ used in DOS.  This is the standard for the CMFS.  You'll \
also notice that the resources directory is accessed as if it were at the root of its own \
drive.  This is also part of the CoffeeMud File System.  Because of this, CoffeeMud is \
utterly unable to access any files outside of its installation directory.  Keep this in mind!\n\r\
\n\r\
Within this installation directory structure, CoffeeMud is able to store files both on your \
local file system drive, and in your database (VFS Files).  The VFS, or Virtual File System, \
refers specifically to files and folders \
which are saved in your database, and accessible through the MUDGrinder's File Browser, \
or the MUD's SHELL command (see HELP SHELL).  When the CoffeeMud directory structure is \
viewed through those two screens, files in the CoffeeMud database and files in the local \
file system are both viewable as if they were part of a single file system, the CMFS.\n\r\
\n\r\
The files referenced in CoffeeMud are case-insensitive, except where dealing with the \
local file system, where it may be case-sensitive depending upon your operating system.  \
Any filename or path may be preceded by a :: string to denote \
forced VFS/database access, or // to denote forced local file-system access.  When neither is \
specified for a given file path, the VFS file is always preferred over the local one. \
For instance, the path ::resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY to a copy of the intro.txt \
file stored in the database as a VFS file. If that file is not in the database when the :: \
string is used, the file will not be found.  The path //resources/text/intro.txt would refer \
ONLY to the copy of the intro.txt file stored in the local file system, even if the same file \
appears in the VFS.  The path resources/text/intro.txt will use the copy of intro.txt stored in \
the VFS *if* it exists there, or the one on the local file system otherwise.\n\r\
\n\r\
The / character is always used to separate directory paths and folders, such as \
/resources/text/intro.txt would refer to the file down.txt in the text folder, which \
in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is located in the root directory.\n\r\
\n\r\
So, as we've seen, whenever you need to refer to a file in CoffeeMud, you should keep this system \
in mind.  Files which are part of your CMFS may be in the VFS database, or in the local file \
system.  They may even be in both! \
This system provides security for the server in which CoffeeMud is being run, and provides for the \
ability to grant folder-level (or even VFS-folder-level) security to builders and other administrative \
users.

FORMULA=MATH_FORMULA
MATH_FORMULA=\
In certain fields and specifications, CoffeeMud will allow you to enter a mathematical formula in \
place of a simple number in order to calculate a number at run-time.  This is useful for occasions \
where you want the number to have a random element, or where the value of the number is calculated \
based on certain variables only available at run-time.\n\r\
\n\r\
The formulas can be anything from a simple number, to numbers combined with mathematical operators \
+ - \\ *, grouped with parenthesis ( ), and may also include certain special operators.\n\r\
\n\r\
One special operator, ? , is for generating a random number (ex: 2?5 refers to a random number \
between 2 and 5).  Another special operator, >, is for bounding the result of an operation \
(ex: 5 * 10 > 10 will evaluate to the greater of 10 or 5 * 10.  The < operator does the opposite.
