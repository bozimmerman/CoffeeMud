Description: \n\r\
This complex property allows the archon to set up mobs or items which, when worn, \
are capable of reflecting spells cast at the mob back to the source.  The min and \
max parms describe the levels of spells which may be reflected.  The chance parm \
describes the % chance of a spell being reflected.  Remain is the number of \
spell levels which may be reflected.  Every time a spell is reflected, the level \
of the spell is subtracted from the remain value.  When remain reaches below 0, the \
item or mob will no longer reflect spells.  Fade describes whether the \
property is persistant or detructive.  If fade is equal to 1 or more, then the \
property is destructive, meaning that the mob will never again gain the fading \
benefit from this property after remain reaches below 0.  If the property was \
on an item, it will be destroyed. If fade is equal to 0, then the property \
is persistant.  The property will still stop working when the remain value \
reaches below 0, but the item will not be destroyed, and will begin to \
regain its strength at a rate of 1 point every 5 minutes or so.

Description: \n\r\
This property WAS used to give MOBs tattoos.  It is deprecated now. \

TATTOO=\
Tattoo's are intended to \
act as miscellaneous flags which players may obtain, not unlike a quest point.  \
These tattoo's can then be checked for as requirements to enter rooms or exits, \
or to possess certain items.\
\n\r\
An example would be like this:  The completion of a specific quest occurs when \
Gunther defeats the evil sorcerer Nunder and enters his inner chamber (where all \
the treasure is hidden).  Entering this inner chamber automatically grants Gunther \
a Tatto called "NUNDERKILLER".  Now, elsewhere in the realm is the second quest \
where Nunder's apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and is up to \
no good.  However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice is operating, \
the system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other Area) requires that \
Gunther already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo.  If Gunther had not defeated \
Nunder and obtained the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo, he would not be allowed into \
the realm of Nunder's apprentice.
