# This file contains definitions for automatically assigned player titles.
# The format of this file is one title definition per line.  A title definition is of the following form:
# [TITLE]=[ZAPPER MASK]
# [TITLE] is a free-form string for the title.  It must be unique in 
# this list.  Titles can include letters, digits, spaces, and special 
# characters except the = sign.  The * character will always be 
# substituted with the players name.  If the title is wrapped in braces 
# {}, then it will denote a mandatory title.  The player may not change 
# a mandatory title.
# [ZAPPER MASK] is a standard mask denoting players who will be given 
# this title.  Players who gain the title can have it taken away should 
# they no longer meet the criterium of the mask.  See archon help on 
# Zapper Masks (AHELP ZAPPERMASKS) from the command line for 
# syntax on zapper-masks.
#
# Player titles are updated every mud-hour (10 mins) automatically by 
# the system for all players on-line and in memory.
#
# Example: 
# {* the dude}=-area "+new area" +midgaard

* is excited=-baseclass +praetor


* the blah=-questwin +normal_collect_1
