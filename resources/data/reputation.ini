# Experience factor
# Does being the same/opposite end of the faction have impact on experience gained?
# Values include:

# EXTREME - experience is proportional to the faction differences.
# HIGHER - experience bonus goes up as my factions value goes toward maximum

# FOLLOWLOWER - experience bonus goes up as my enemies value goes toward minimum

# Change Triggers - these decide how a faction value changes, when, by how much,
# and under what circumstances.  The first value in the list of changes is the 
# trigger type.  Types include the following:
# MURDER - when someone with this faction kills another who matches the ZAPPER part of
# 	of the change trigger definition.
# TIME - a change in value that occurs every 10 ticks (around 40 seconds) to those
#	with standing in this faction, and who meet the ZAPPER mask requirements.
# Ability ID - the ID of a skill, spell, or similar Ability.  Ability IDs can be seen
#	by entering from the command line: list skills, list spells, list prayers, etc..
# Ability type description - the name of a type of an ability (SPELL, PRAYER, SKILLS, 
#	SONG, CHANT, COMMON SKILL, THIEF SKILL, etc..)
# Ability domain description - the name of a spell domain (ILLUSION, TRANSMUTATION, 
#	INVOCATION/EVOCATION, DIVINATION, etc...)
# Ability flag description - the name of one of the ability flags defined in the 
#	coffeemud source code in interfaces/Ability.java.  HEALING, for instance, 
#	if you want ANY healing abilities to initiate this change.
# ADDOUTSIDER - this trigger occurs every 10 ticks, and allows the a player who does
#	not have standing in the faction, so long as they meet the target trigger requirements,
#	to have the faction added using the ADD flag in the next (Direction) section of this
#	trigger definition.
# 
# 1) The Directions:
#   a. UP – Faction increases by the standard amount (plus any adjustments)
#   b. DOWN – Faction decreases by the standard amount (plus any adjustments)
#   c. TOWARDS - Faction increases or decreases towards the faction of the target.
#      If there is no target, then there is no change.
#   d. AWAY - Faction increases or decreases away from the faction of the target.
#      If there is no target, then there is no change.
#   c. OPPOSITE – Faction decreases away from and proportional to the faction of the target
#      If there is no target, then there is no change.
#   d. MINIMUM – the player instantly gets the lowest possible faction
#   e. MAXIMUM – the player instantly gets the highest possible faction
#   f. REMOVE  - the player has the faction removed from their list.
#   g. ADD - the player has the faction added to their list using above DEFAULTs.  Only useful
#	   with the ADDOUTSIDER trigger.
# 
# 2) Change factor – a multiplier for the change.  This can be used for major/minor infractions..
#	Since normal values are between 0 and 150 points, this can be used to raise or lower this
#	amount.
# 
# 3) FLAGS - this section may optionally contain one or more of the following, space delimited:
#
# 		OUTSIDER Flag – Normally, when a target is present, the change only applies if the 
#		target also has standing in this faction.  Including this flag will allow the 
#		change to apply even if the target does not.
# 
# 		SELFOK flag.  Normally a change event will NOT trigger is the source and target are 
#		the same person. This flag will allow a change event to trigger on an action that 
#		is targeting the source.  This is not recommended because someone can just spam 
#		their faction in one direction or another.
# 
# 		JUST100 flag.  Normally the base unadjusted amount of a movement is based partially
#		on a comparison between the levels of the source and target, making sure they are
#		within the range contemplated by the "EXPRATE" entry in the coffeemud.ini file.  
#		Including this flag will override this adjustment, leaving the base rate a flag 100 points.
# 
# 4) Zapper string.  You can specify a target mob filter for change events.  So, in
# 	“#CHANGE3=Prayer_Bless;UP;100%;OUTSIDER;-RACE +RODENT”, anytime a player with the
#  	Alignment faction blesses a mob with the Rodent race, their faction will go up.
# 	This change will not trigger if cast on a human.
#
# Change string format:
# CHANGEX = [TYPE];[DIRECTION];[FACTOR %];[FLAGS];[ZAPPER]
CHANGE1=MURDER;UP;100%;OUTSIDER;;
CHANGE2=TIME;DOWN;100%;;

# Controlling whether, by default, an ability of the type, or with the given flag, 
# is flagged as being appropriate for the given range of faction.  This has a big
# impact on some character classes, and especially on MOB skill usage.
# The first parameter is either a skill ID, type, spell domain, or flag name.  Flag
# names can be prefixed with a "!" to denote the requirement that this flag NOT be found.
# All first parm values must match a given skill before the faction range check 
# is made to evaluate elligibility. 
# ABILITYX = [SKILL NAME/TYPE/DOMAIN/FLAGS];[MIN RANGE];[MAX RANGE]
