#There are several "operators" available:
#  pattern matching:     Which work only in ( string | string & (str ~ str))
#        |       or
#        &       and
#        ~       and-not
#  special pattern matching:
#        ^       match start  This anchors the match to the beginning of the 
#                             input string.
#        =       exact match  This must match the input string entirely.
#        /       beginning and end of a coffeemud specific zappermask
#  pass 1 scan operators:
#        (       beginning of a 'say' expression
#        [       beginning of a non-say expression targeted
#        {       beginning of a non-say expression not targeted
#        <       beginning of a set matched every mudchat tick, may contain
#                 a number 1-100 representing percentage chance of triggering
#        *       combat expression, must preceed (, [, or {
#        #       remark
#        "       output to stderr
#        '       output to stdout
#        >       start of named database, there can be more than one name
#                 to a database '> dragon red_dragon'  The _ here is treated
#                 as a space in the name.  You may also use the / operator.
#        %       include another file inline Ex: %talk.data
#        @       adds a continue jump to link to the database. Ex: @dog
#                 will make a continue link to the dog database.  Use @default
#                 to link to the default database. Only 1 @ per database.
#                 @ cannot do forward links!!!
#                 @ is more memory efficient than % but less flexible.
#                 You must avoid circularities with @. 
#  response operators:
#        1-9     weights are the numerals. First column only. Mandatory.
#        "       Issue response as "say".   Muds and 2nd column only. Optional.
#        :       Issue repsonse as "emote". Muds and 2nd column only. Optional.
#        !       Issue response as command. Muds and 2nd column only. Optional.
#                 Note, you do not need a space after an :,", or !
#  
#        $?      Are variables where ? is a case sensitive letter.
#                 $r is rest of sentence, $n is its name, $t is target's name.
#                 They may appear anywhere in the response, multiple times.
#        $%...%  Causes the part of the sentence and the rest of the line to
#                be evaluated by the MOBPROG Scriptable system.
#         ~      Separates one or more responses on a line.  May be followed by
#                 one of operators: ", :, or !.
#        
#Some special notes:
#	#,',",weights, and the first (,[,or { must be in column one.
#
#Syntax of a simple pattern match:
#
#( A | B & C ~ ( D | E | F))  'say command targeted at the mob
#[ A | B & C ~ ( D | E | F)]  'another action targeted at the mob
#{ A | B & C ~ ( D | E | F)}  'another action not targeted at mob
#
#The above would mean if A or B and C and-not D or E or F was in the
#sentence then pick one of the responses.
#
#The responses take on the form:
#
#9this is most likely
#4somewhat likely
#1least likely
#
#Responses or pattern match strings may not span more than one line.  
#The guaranted line length is a magic 80 characters (letters) wide. 
#
#Please note the system will return the first match found. So
#please put more ambigous matches last!!
#

#I suggest adding to this database.


# $r is a variable.  It means rest of sentence after the match.
#Variables only appear in weighted reponse clauses.
#Weighted clauses are '9This is a clause', with 9 being the weight.
# $n is the characters name
# $t is the targets name (the person who being replied to)
# $$ is equal to $
