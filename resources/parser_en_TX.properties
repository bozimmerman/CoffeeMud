# Miscellaneous string parser definition file extending user input.
# The purpose of this file is to extend the english-language parsing
# system of CoffeeMud.  This file is also intended for use as the 
# user-input translation file for internationalization, mainly through
# the command-pre-processor section of this file.
#
# This file is divided into four sections: 
# * the command-word-processor, which allows you to translate in-code
# ability and other command words at boot time
# * the command-pre-processor, which allows you to parse and manipulate 
# command strings entered by players before the main coffeemud parser gets 
# ahold of it, 
# * the item-pre-processor, which allows you to parse the names of items, 
# mobs, exits before they are searched for in inventories and on the ground, 
# * the failed-item-processor, which allows you to take another try with the 
# names of items and mobs when a preliminary search has failed to find anything 
# matching in inventories or on the ground.
# * the raw-input-processor, which allows you to parse input to certain non-command, 
# prompts, such as the login system. 
#
# There several commands defined for each section:
# replacewhole "string literal" with "string literal"
#    This command will replace the first string with the second string
#    only if the entire translatable string is equal to the first
#    string argument.  This is easily the best performing command for
#    doing translations, and should be preferred above others wherever
#    possible and practical.  It is case insensitive.
# replaceexact "string literal" with "string literal"
#    This command will replace the first string with the second string
#    only if the entire translatable string is equal to the first
#    string argument.  This is easily the best performing command for
#    doing translations, and should be preferred above others wherever
#    possible and practical.  It is case sensitive.
# replace "regular expression pattern" with "replacement pattern"
#    This command will search for the given regular expression pattern in
#    the string.  If it is found, the string following the with clause 
#    will be used to change the string to something else.  Regular 
#    expressions are exactly as they are defined in the Java API.
#    Replacement expressions may include literals, or a slash followed
#    by a number to insert Java "capturing groups" from the search
#    expression.  The double quotes around the expressions are required.
#    You may escape a quote with a backslash to include it in your expressions.
# replaceall "sub-string literal" with "string literal"
#    This command will search for all instances of the given sub-string in the
#    translatable input string and replace them with the given string literal. This
#    command is good for catching references to hard coded named things, such
#    as spell names and the like.  It performs much better than the normal replace
#    command, but is still far more of a performance hit than replacewhole.
# ignorewhole "string literal"
#    This command will cause the entire string to be ignored by the translator
#    if it matches the given string. This is easily the best performing ignore for
#    ignoring translation strings, and should be preferred above ignore and 
#    ignoreall wherever possible and practical.
# ignore "regular expression pattern"
#    This command will search for the given reguar expression pattern in
#    the string.  If it is found, the entire string is ignored by the translator. 
#    Regular expressions are exactly as they are defined in the Java API.
#    This is the worst performing ignore command, but also the most versatile.
#    Still use it sparingly, be careful with your regular expression syntax,
#    and read the information about escape sequences below.
# ignoreall "sub-string literal" with "string literal"
#    This command will search for an instance of the given sub-string in the
#    translatable string and, if found, ignore then entire translatable input string. 
#    This command is good for catching references to hard coded named things, such
#    as spell names and the like.  It performs much better than the normal ignore
#    command, but is still far more of a performance hit than ignorewhole.
# autoignore <max-string-length>
#    This command will cause any translatable input strings which were not modified by
#    the translator in any way to be added automatically to the section list as
#    a "IGNOREWHOLE" command, thus preventing it from being re-parsed the next
#    time it is encountered.  Because users can type anything, you should be careful 
#    with this command.  If it is used, your file should be re-examined regularly 
#    and the newly added IGNOREWHOLE strings changed to some other command.
# define "variable string" as "replacement string"
#    This command is used to define strings which will be replaced inside of
#    other commands.  A variable definition will apply only to the section in
#    which it is defined.  The replacement will be applied to both expressions
#    and replacement strings in the REPLACE command, as well as in the 
#    replacement string of other DEFINE commands.  This command may be placed
#    before the first section to make it "global" to all sections.
#
# Escape characters:  
#    In the commands IGNOREALL/REPLACEALL and IGNOREWHOLE, REPLACEWHOLE,
#    the only characters which must be escaped are " with \", tabs with \t, \ with \\, 
#    and cr/lf \n\r.
#    For the REPLACE/IGNORE commands, the regular expression parameter must have all
#    special regular expression characters escaped in order to be matched.  Those include: 
#    . ( ) { } [ ] ^ $ ? * + |  
#
# The command pre-processor has a few extra features for the replace-like commands.  One
# is that individual command words will be pre-parsed and separated by tabs, which
# may be represented in your expressions by the \t character.  The replacement 
# expression may contains \n characters to denote that the command should be 
# separated into two or more other commands.  Be sure to maintain the \t structure
# of the string in order for CoffeeMud to properly parse your commands.
