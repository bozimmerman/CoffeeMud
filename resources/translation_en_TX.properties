# String translation definition file
# The purpose of this file is to translate output 
#
# There are three separate sections in this file
# [session-translation]
#    This is the primary string mapping that is processed by
#    the translation engine before it goes through the CoffeeMud
#    filtration process.
# [filter-translation]
#    During the filtration process, certain codes may be replaced
#    with hard-coded english words.  This short section is to 
#    handle those words specifically.
# [final-translation]
#    After the string has gone through session translation and 
#    filter-translation, it will finally be parsed by the definitions
#    in this section to catch any stray strings which may not be handled
#    by either of the first two sections.
#
# there are several commands defined for each section:
# replacewhole "string literal" with "string literal"
#    This command will replace the first string with the second string
#    only if the entire translatable string is equal to the first
#    string argument.  This is easily the best performing command for
#    doing translations, and should be preferred above others wherever
#    possible and practical.  It is case insensitive.
# replaceexact "string literal" with "string literal"
#    This command will replace the first string with the second string
#    only if the entire translatable string is equal to the first
#    string argument.  This is easily the best performing command for
#    doing translations, and should be preferred above others wherever
#    possible and practical.  It is case sensitive.
# replace "regular expression pattern" with "replacement pattern"
#    This command will search for the given regular expression pattern in
#    the string.  If it is found, the string following the with clause 
#    will be used to change the string to something else.  Regular 
#    expressions are exactly as they are defined in the Java API.
#    Replacement expressions may include literals, or a slash followed
#    by a number to insert Java "capturing groups" from the search
#    expression.  The double quotes around the expressions are required.
#    This is the worst performing command, but also the most versatile.
#    Still use it sparingly, be careful with your regular expression syntax,
#    and read the information about escape sequences below.
# replaceall "sub-string literal" with "string literal"
#    This command will search for all instances of the given sub-string in the
#    translatable string and replace them with the given string literal. This
#    command is good for catching references to hard coded named things, such
#    as spell names and the like.  It performs much better than the normal replace
#    command, but is still far more of a performance hit than replacewhole.
# ignorewhole "string literal"
#    This command will cause the entire string to be ignored by the translator
#    if it matches the given string. This is easily the best performing ignore for
#    ignoring translation strings, and should be preferred above ignore and 
#    ignoreall wherever possible and practical.
# ignore "regular expression pattern"
#    This command will search for the given regular expression pattern in
#    the string.  If it is found, the entire string is ignored by the translator. 
#    Regular expressions are exactly as they are defined in the Java API.
#    This is the worst performing ignore command, but also the most versatile.
#    Still use it sparingly, be careful with your regular expression syntax,
#    and read the information about escape sequences below.
# ignoreall "sub-string literal"
#    This command will search for an instance of the given sub-string in the
#    translatable string and, if found, ignore then entire translatable string. 
#    This command is good for catching references to hard coded named things, such
#    as spell names and the like.  It performs much better than the normal ignore
#    command, but is still far more of a performance hit than ignorewhole.
# autoignore <max-string-length>
#    This command will cause any translatable strings which were not modified by
#    the translator in any way to be added automatically to the section list as
#    a "IGNOREWHOLE" command, thus preventing it from being re-parsed the next
#    time it is encountered.  Because variables are often included inside
#    translatable strings, you should be careful with this command.  If it is
#    used, your file should be re-examined regularly and the newly added IGNOREWHOLE 
#    strings changed to some other command.
# define "variable string" as "replacement string"
#    This command is used to define strings which will be replaced inside of
#    other commands.  A variable definition will apply only to the section in
#    which it is defined.  The replacement will be applied to both expressions
#    and replacement strings in the REPLACE command, as well as in the 
#    replacement string of other DEFINE commands.  This command may be placed
#    before the first section to make it "global" to all sections.
#
# Escape characters:  
#    In the commands IGNOREALL/REPLACEALL and IGNOREWHOLE, REPLACEWHOLE,
#    the only characters which must be escaped are " with \", tabs with \t, \ with \\, 
#    and cr/lf \n\r.
#    For the REPLACE/IGNORE commands, the regular expression parameter must have all
#    special regular expression characters escaped in order to be matched.  Those include: 
#    . ( ) { } [ ] ^ $ ? * + |
