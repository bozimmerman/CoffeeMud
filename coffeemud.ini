# PREJUDICE is used to define both the buying and selling
# adjustments which shopkeepers will give by default, both 
# to everyone or to selected races.  An entry is required for each 
# adjustment by race.  Each entry is separated by a semicolon, and must
# begin with either BUY= or SELL=.  Each entry may end with the name of
# more than one race to apply to other than everyone. The values for BUY=
# and SELL= are Real (decimal) numbers, with 1.0 meaning NO adjustment.
# See the Archon's Guide under What Areas are Worth for more information on this
# field.
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers or areas.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.
# Default value is empty, which uses adjustment 1.0 for everyone.
# An example value would be:
# BUY=5.5 SELL=0.8 Elf Dwarf;BUY=2.0 SELL=0.9 Human;BUY=1.0;SELL=.99
PREJUDICE=

# PRICEFACTORS is used to define both the buying and selling
# adjustments which shopkeepers will give by default, for select
# items or types of items.  An entry is required for each 
# adjustment by type of item.  Each entry is separated by a semicolon, and must
# begin with a real (decimal) number with 1.0 meaning NO adjustment.  That is
# followed by a space and a zapper mask describing the types of items to

# DEVALUERATE is the percentage drop in price for every additional item
# of a given name that is sold to the shopkeeper.  This rate is always
# taken off of an items base price, so that a devalue rate of 100 (100%)
# will always limit a shopkeeper from buying more than one, 50 limits to
# 2, 25 limits to 4, 12.5 to 8, and so forth.  
# If a single value is given, it will apply to all items.  If two values
# are given, separated by spaces, then the first will apply to all items,
# and the second only to raw resource items (raw wood, raw metals, stone, etc).
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers or areas.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.
# See the Archon's Guide under What Areas are Worth for more information.
# The Default is "20 0.2" (20% 0.2%) which means 0.2% for resources, 20% other Items.
DEVALUERATE=20 0.2

# INVRESETRATE is the frequency, in ticks (4 second intervals), that a
# shopkeeper, by default, will totally reset his inventory.  This means
# that any items purchased from players will be cleared out, and any
# default stock will be replentished.  A value of 0 means that the
# shopkeeper NEVER resets his inventory.  A value above 0 is the 
# amoung of time, in ticks.  
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers or areas.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.
# See the Archon's Guide under What Areas are Worth for more information.
# The default is 64800 (about 3 real life days).
INVRESETRATE=64800

# AUCTIONRATES is a comma delimited list of prices that the engine will

# GenCharClass, GenRace, DefaultPlayerStats, most of the various
# Generic MOB and Item types (GenItem, GenWeapon, GenMob, GenArmor, etc), 
# Rooms (StdRoom, Woods, etc), and Areas (StdArea, etc).
# These are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "EXTVAR_" 
# followed by the Class ID (GenWeapon, Woods, etc).  Each entry should
# be set equal to a comma-delimited list of new variable names you 
# would like to add to the class object.  The variables will then begin
# to appear in the object editors, and will be saved and persisted in 
# the database.
#
# Example: EXTVAR_GenArmor=SHININESS,COLOR,EMBLEM  

# ADDCHARSTAT and REPLACECHARSTAT allow you to add or modify character 
# stats used by the coffeemud engine.  Character stats are things like 
# STRENGTH, DEXTERITY, saving throws, etc.  These will be displayed in 
# appropriate plaes, and their values will be your player's db records.
# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDCHARSTAT_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new stat to create, or "REPLACECHARSTAT_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old stat.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the new stat (or redefine

# 1. a stat type (BASE, SAVE, OTHER, or a new stat name when REPLACEing), 
# 2. a unique 2 letter abbreviation, 
# 3. a description, 
# 4. an adjective.  
# For example:
# ADDCHARSTAT_NEWSTAT=SAVE,ns,my new stat,newstatty
# REPLACECHARSTAT_STRENGTH=NEWSTAT,ns,my new stat,newstatty

# ADDMATERIAL and REPLACEMATERIAL allow you to add or modify the physical 
# resources used by the coffeemud engine for items.  These are things like 
# PORK, MITHRIL, LEATHER, LAMP_OIL, etc.  These will be displayed in 
# appropriate places, and their values will available to your archons.
# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDMATERIAL_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new resource to create, or "REPLACEMATERIAL_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old res.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the resource (or redefine 
# the old one).  These fields are, respectively: 
# 1. a material (CLOTH, LEATHER, METAL,MITHRIL, WOODEN, GLASS, VEGETATION, 
#    FLESH, PAPER, ROCK, LIQUID, PRECIOUS, ENERGY, PLASTIC), 
# 2. a smell (if any), 
# 3. value, 
# 4. rarity weight (1-100, lower=rarer), 
# 5. hardness (0-6), 
# 6. bouancy (0-30000), 
# 7. the gathering category (FISH, BERRY, or nothing).
# 8. an optional ability ID (currently only for eating the raw form)
# For example:
# ADDMATERIAL_FLUFF=cloth,,0,100,0,10,,
# REPLACEMATERIAL_COTTON=cloth,,0,100,0,10,,
# ADDMATERIAL_GRUG=flesh,strong meaty,3,15,1,2000,FISH,

# ADDWEARLOC and REPLACEWEARLOC allow you to add or modify the wearable  
# locations used by the coffeemud engine for mobs.  These are things like 
# left finger, on eyes, on torso, etc.  These will be displayed in 
# appropriate places, and their values will available to your archons.
# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDWEARLOC_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new location to create, or "REPLACEWEARLOC_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old loc.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the location (or redefine 
# the old one).  These fields are, respectively: 
# 1. a list of wear locations dependent on this one sep. by | characters, 
# 2. the armor score of this location (0.0 - 2.0), 
# 3. the displayed order (0-n), 
# 4. the weight score for cloth (0.0 - 10.0), 
# 5. for leather (0.0 - 10.0), 
# 6. for metal (0.0 - 10.0).  
# For example:
