# Miscellaneous Game related configuration variables
######################################################################

# The AUTOPURGE is a comma-separated list of conditions and days which
# together describe how long a character will remain in the player database
# despite not having logged on.  The condition must start with a comparison 
# on the level of the player, such as <2 >3, <=4, >=5 etc.  This  is followed
# by a space and the number of rl days that their account will remain
# before being automatically purged. If this amount evaluates to zero, then 
# the account will never be purged. After that is the number of rl days before
# autopurging to email a warning. If this amount evaluates to zero, then 
# the account will never be warned.  Use the NOPURGE game command to protect 
# specific players and override this setting.  To disable all player character
# purging, use a setting of: >=0 0 0
# The default is >=0 0 0
# Example: <2 10 0, <3 15 1, <10 30 2, <90 90 7, >=90 0 0

# EXTVAR refers to a list of optional INI file entries to have admin-
# defined variables "tacked on" to existing CoffeeMud objects, especially
# GenCharClass, GenRace, DefaultPlayerStats, most of the various
# Generic MOB and Item types (GenItem, GenWeapon, GenMob, GenArmor, etc), 
# Rooms (StdRoom, Woods, etc), and Areas (StdArea, etc).
# These are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "EXTVAR_" 
# followed by the Class ID (GenWeapon, Woods, etc).  Each entry should
# be set equal to a comma-delimited list of new variable names you 
# would like to add to the class object.  The variables will then begin
# to appear in the object editors, and will be saved and persisted in 
# the database.
#
# Example: EXTVAR_GenArmor=SHININESS,COLOR,EMBLEM  

# ADDCHARSTAT and REPLACECHARSTAT allow you to add or modify character 
# stats used by the coffeemud engine.  Character stats are things like 
# STRENGTH, DEXTERITY, saving throws, etc.  These will be displayed in 
# appropriate places, and their values will be your player's db records.
# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDCHARSTAT_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new stat to create, or "REPLACECHARSTAT_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old stat.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the new stat (or redefine

# 1. a stat type (BASE, SAVE, OTHER, or a new stat name when REPLACEing), 
# 2. a unique 2 letter abbreviation, 
# 3. a 2-3 word descriptive name, 
# 4. an adjective.  
# For example:
# ADDCHARSTAT_NEWSTAT=SAVE,ns,my new stat,newstatty
# REPLACECHARSTAT_STRENGTH=NEWSTAT,ns,my new stat,newstatty

# ADDMATERIAL and REPLACEMATERIAL allow you to add or modify the physical 
# resources used by the coffeemud engine for items.  These are things like 
# PORK, MITHRIL, LEATHER, LAMP_OIL, etc.  These will be displayed in 
# appropriate places, and their values will available to your archons.
# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDMATERIAL_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new resource to create, or "REPLACEMATERIAL_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old res.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the resource (or redefine 
# the old one).  These fields are, respectively: 
# 1. a material (CLOTH, LEATHER, METAL,MITHRIL, WOODEN, GLASS, VEGETATION, 
#    FLESH, PAPER, ROCK, LIQUID, PRECIOUS, ENERGY, PLASTIC), 
# 2. a smell (if any), 
# 3. value, 
# 4. rarity weight (1-100, lower=rarer), 
# 5. hardness (0-6), 
# 6. buoyancy (0-30000), 
# 7. the gathering category (FISH, BERRY, WOODY, or nothing).
# 8. an optional ability ID (currently only for eating the raw form)
# For example:
# ADDMATERIAL_FLUFF=cloth,,0,100,0,10,,
# REPLACEMATERIAL_COTTON=cloth,,0,100,0,10,,
# ADDMATERIAL_GRUG=flesh,strong meaty,3,15,1,2000,FISH,

# ADDWEARLOC and REPLACEWEARLOC allow you to add or modify the wearable  
# locations used by the coffeemud engine for mobs.  These are things like 
# left finger, on eyes, on torso, etc.  These will be displayed in 
# appropriate places, and their values will available to your archons.
# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDWEARLOC_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new location to create, or "REPLACEWEARLOC_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old loc.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the location (or redefine 
# the old one).  These fields are, respectively: 
# 1. a list of wear locations dependent on this one sep. by | characters, 
# 2. the armor score of this location (0.0 - 2.0), 
# 3. the displayed order (0-n), 
# 4. the weight score for cloth (0.0 - 10.0), 
# 5. for leather (0.0 - 10.0), 
# 6. for metal (0.0 - 10.0).  
# For example:
# ADDWEARLOC_FACE=eyes|mouth,0.2,16,0.5,0.7,1.0
# REPLACEWEARLOC_EYES=,0.1,7,0.1,0.2,0.3

# PREJUDICE is used to define both the buying and selling
# adjustments which shopkeepers will give by default, both 
# to everyone or to selected races.  An entry is required for each 
# adjustment by race.  Each entry is separated by a semicolon, and must
# begin with either BUY= or SELL=.  BUY is buying from a shopkeeper, 
# and SELL is selling to a shopkeeper. Each entry may end with the name of
# more than one race to apply to other than everyone. The values for BUY=
# and SELL= are Real (decimal) numbers, with 1.0 meaning NO adjustment.
# See the Archon's Guide under What Areas are Worth for more information on this
# field.
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers or areas.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.

# DEVALUERATE is the percentage drop in price for every additional item
# of a given name that is sold to the shopkeeper.  This rate is always
# taken off of an items base price, so that a devalue rate of 100 (100%)
# will always limit a shopkeeper from buying more than one, 50 limits to
# 2, 25 limits to 4, 12.5 to 8, and so forth.  
# If a single value is given, it will apply to all items.  If two values
# are given, separated by spaces, then the first will apply to all items,
# and the second only to raw resource items (raw wood, raw metals, stone, etc).
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers or areas.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.
# See the Archon's Guide under What Areas are Worth for more information.

DEVALUERATE=20 0.2

# INVRESETRATE is the frequency, in ticks (4 second intervals), that a
# shopkeeper, by default, will totally reset his inventory.  This means
# that any items purchased from players will be cleared out, and any
# default stock will be replenished.  A value of 0 means that the
# shopkeeper NEVER resets his inventory.  A value above 0 is the 
# amount of time, in ticks.  
# This field may also be defined for individual shopkeepers or areas.
# The value here is only the default when no individual value is given.

# EXPERIENCE, RACES, CLASSES, LEVELS
# Disable can be used to disable all experience gaining and losing as well 
# as level gaining and losing.   Races and Classes can also be disabled 
# from display, although they still impact skill qualifications and other 
# factors behind the scenes.  If races are disabled, then all new players 
# be set to "PlayerRace" if it exists, or StdRace otherwise.  If classes 
# are disabled, all new players will be set to "PlayerClass" if it exists, 
# or  StdCharClass otherwise.
# 
# STDRACES, STDCLASSES 
# If you want to quickly turn off standard player races and/or classes and 
# start building your own generic ones from scratch, you can expel them from 
# character creation (but not from magical effects) with this.
#
# RACE_HALFELF, RACE_*, CHARCLASS_SKYWATCHER, CHARCLASS_* 
# If you want to quickly turn off access to a specific player race or class, 
# simply use RACE_  or CHARCLASS_ followed by the ID, in uppercase, of the

# determining exploration stats later on.  This is potentially a HUGE memory
# hog, so turn this off if your memory is limited.
#
# CLASSTRAINING 
# Disables the ability of players to use the Train command to change their
# class.  Other Training features are unaffected.  Make sure you provide
# other mechanisms for class changes if you use this feature, such as 
# scripting or clan classes.

# mode.  The text file resources/text/offline.txt is shown to them.
#
# NEWPLAYERS, NEWCHARACTERS
# Disables the ability of those without accounts to create their own
# players at login.  Be sure to put something in your intro.txt to let

# account system, you can disable NEWCHARACTERS also to disable both account
# and character creation.
#
# PASSIVEAREAS
# Disables the way the system renders standard-mobile mobs immobile, and stops
# standard aggressive behaviors from occurring when a player has not been in 
# an area for 30 minutes or more (restarting it when they re-enter the areas)
#
# ALLERGIES
# Disables the automatic assignment of a random allergy to new players.
#
# AUTODISEASE

# The ENABLE flag is for enabling features of the engine which are 
# normally disabled, such as most races, character classes in beta,
# or other features considered untested.
#
# To enable access to a specific player race or class that is disabled 
# by default, simply use RACE_ or CHARCLASS_ followed by the ID, 
# in uppercase, of the thing to re-enable.  CHARCLASS_ IDs can also be
# followed by one or more race IDs to create a race/class qualification. 
# RACE_ and CHARCLASS_ flags can also be added as Account tattoos to 
# enable individual access.
#
# Eg: "RACE_OGRE, CHARCLASS_FIGHTER OGRE, CHARCLASS_WIZARD OGRE" 
# The above would enable the ogre race for players and let them be fighters 
# and wizards.
# Example: RACE_OGRE, RACE_GNOLL, RACE_SVIRFNEBLIN, RACE_GITHYANKI, RACE_LIZARDMAN, 
# Example: RACE_AARAKOCRAN, RACE_MERFOLK, RACE_PIXIE, RACE_ORC, RACE_MINDFLAYER,
