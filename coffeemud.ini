# Example: START_FIGHTER=FighterSchool#10

# ADDMATERIAL and REPLACEMATERIAL allow you to add or modify the physical 
# resources used by the coffeemud engine for items.  These are things like 
# PORK, MITHRIL, LEATHER, LAMP_OIL, etc.  These will be displayed in

# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDMATERIAL_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new resource to create, or "REPLACEMATERIAL_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old res.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the resource (or redefine 
# the old one).  These fields are, respectively: 
# 1. a material (CLOTH, LEATHER, METAL,MITHRIL, WOODEN, GLASS, VEGETATION,

# REPLACEMATERIAL_COTTON=cloth,,0,100,0,10,,
# ADDMATERIAL_GRUG=flesh,strong meaty,3,15,1,2000,FISH,

# ADDWEARLOC and REPLACEWEARLOC allow you to add or modify the wearable  
# locations used by the coffeemud engine for mobs.  These are things like 
# left finger, on eyes, on torso, etc.  These will be displayed in

# They are defined by creating a new INI entry of the form "ADDWEARLOC_" 
# followed by the NAME of the new location to create, or "REPLACEWEARLOC_" 
# followed by the NAME of the old loc.  Each entry is then set equal to 
# a comma-delimited list of fields that define the location (or redefine

# 1. a list of wear locations dependent on this one sep. by | characters, 
# 2. the armor score of this location (0.0 - 2.0), 
# 3. the displayed order (0-n), 
# 4. the weight score for cloth (0.0 - 10.0), 
# 5. for leather (0.0 - 10.0),

# The ENABLE flag is for enabling features of the engine which are 
# normally disabled, such as most races, character classes in beta,

#
# To enable access to a specific player race or class that is disabled 
# by default, simply use RACE_ or CHARCLASS_ followed by the ID, 
# in uppercase, of the thing to re-enable.  CHARCLASS_ IDs can also be
# followed by one or more race IDs to create a race/class qualification. 
# These race IDs may begin with minus sign (-) to remove an existing
# qualification. 
# Eg: "RACE_OGRE, CHARCLASS_FIGHTER OGRE, CHARCLASS_WIZARD OGRE" 
# The above would enable the ogre race for players and let them be fighters 
# and wizards.
# Example: RACE_OGRE, RACE_GNOLL, RACE_SVIRFNEBLIN, RACE_GITHYANKI, RACE_LIZARDMAN, 
# Example: RACE_AARAKOCRAN, RACE_MERFOLK, RACE_PIXIE, RACE_ORC, RACE_MINDFLAYER,

# NOCACHE is a list, seperated by commas, of which internal

# The TICKTIME value defines how many miliseconds between each thread "tick".  
# This is a massively powerful number that affects everything from combat,

TICKTIME=4000

# MINWORKERTHREADS is the minimum number of threads that will be set aside,

MINWORKERTHREADS=5

# MAXWORKERTHREADS is the maximum number of threads that will be active, 
# per mud host, to handle player I/O and player command execution, as well

# BLACKLISTFILE is the path/name of a file containing a list of ip addresses

# WHITELISTIPSCONN is a comma-delimited list of ip addresses or ip address masks

# WHITELISTLOGINS is a comma-delimited list of player names, account names, or

# (See DEBUG above) and names for the MAXCONNSPERIP or MAXCONNSPERACCOUNT 
# above.  Default is empty.
