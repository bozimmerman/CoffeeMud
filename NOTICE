   Bo would like to acknowledge and thank the following 
   people for contributing, both directly and indirectly 
   to the development of CoffeeMud.

   Tim Kassebaum, for putting in lord knows how many hours 
   doing head and documentation work for versions 3.0 -, 
   including just about every spell, prayer, subclasses, and 
   common skill, for uncountable ideas (and for documenting 
   those too), and for SOMEHOW finding time to playtest amidst
   all this.  And of course Hojo, playtesting, bugfinding FOOL!

   Jeremy Vyska for clan, Faction and miscellaneous enhancements.

   The good people at www.yourkit.com for supporting us with
   licenses to their java profiling software.

   Jef Kamenek and David Walters, for single handedly adding 
   the ANSI support, Archon Help, some very important changes 
   to the base MUD class, and for writing the base of the web 
   server system.

   Thomas Neumann for the fakedb package.

   George Reese for kindly providing his I3 java implementation.

   Sky for the Moving Behavior.

   Lee H. Fox - for numerous coded weapon, armor, and MOB objects 
   and for providing the base code for the Drow behavior.  Lee also 
   wrote some of the Mage spells, including "Grace of the Cat", 
   "Giant Strength" and many others.

   Michael Rundell - for a few of the coded weapon, armor, and MOB 
   objects, including the coded Dragon object, and for providing 
   the base code for the Dragonbreath ability and the MOBEater behavior.

   Tyra and Lori - for single handedly inspiring this project.  I have 
   never ever forgotten that fact, nor the unusual circumstances 
   surrounding it.  I hope in time they have forgiven me. :)
