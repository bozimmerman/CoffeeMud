   Bo would like to acknowledge and thank the following 
   people for contributing, both directly and indirectly 
   to the development of CoffeeMud.

   Tim Kassebaum, for putting in lord knows how many hours 
   doing head and documentation work for versions 3.0 - 5.0, 
   including just about every spell, prayer, subclasses, and 
   common skill, for uncountable ideas (and for documenting 
   those too), and for SOMEHOW finding time to playtest amidst 
   all this. 

   Benny Edwards, for breaking or finding exploits in just 
   about every administrative feature he had access to. 

   Stuart, a patient and attentive problem solver, and then 
   there's Hojo- a playtesting, bugfinding FOOL!

   Jeremy Vyska for the base of clans, factions, parent/child areas 
   and for other miscellaneous and useful enhancements.
   
   Jonathon Taylor for many great distilling recipes.

   The good people at www.yourkit.com for supporting us with 
   licenses to their java profiling software.

   Jef Kamenek and David Walters, for single handedly adding 
   the ANSI support, Archon Help, some changes to the base 
   MUD class, and for contributions to the design of the web 
   macro system.

   Thomas Neumann for the fakedb package.

   George Reese for kindly providing his I3 java implementation.

   Sky for the MovingRoom Behavior.

   Lee H. Fox - for numerous standard weapon, armor, and MOB objects 
   and for providing the base code for the Drow behavior.  Lee also 
   wrote some of the Mage spells, including "Grace of the Cat", 
   "Giant Strength" and many others.

   Michael Rundell - for a few of the standard weapon, armor, and MOB 
   objects, including the coded Dragon object, and for providing 
   the base code for the Dragonbreath ability and the MOBEater behavior.

   Tyra and Lori - for single handedly inspiring this project.  I have 
   never ever forgotten that fact, nor the unusual circumstances 
   surrounding it.  I hope in time they have forgiven me. :)
