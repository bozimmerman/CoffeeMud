<P>Causing buildings and towers to appear along paved streets, mountains to rise 
from the dust, and then breathing life into this worlds denizens may seem like a 
daunting task, but you will quickly discover that it is not so.&nbsp; All it 
takes is some careful planning, and educated execution.</P>
<P>Towards that end, but before we get started properly on the business of 
molding a universe, we must needs take a moment to reflect on the powers of the 
Archon, and how the universes underlying laws are navigated.&nbsp; Herein, 
therefore, I have copied from the sacred scrolls the archaic and confusing runes 
of "CoffeeMud Administration" for your consideration.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=red 
size=5>CoffeeMud Administration</FONT> </STRONG></P>
<P align=left>       The administration of 
your CoffeeMud server is done from within the game server itself, when you are 
logged in as your Archon player.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some functions can be performed from the 
<A href="MUDGrinder.html">MUDGrinder</A>.</P>
<P align=left><EM>AHELP<BR></EM>This is the command that Archons will use to get help 
on all of the commands in this section, on various administrative topics, and on 
all of the various building "tools" discussed elsewhere in this document, 
including such things as behaviors and properties.&nbsp; The atopics command can 
give you a comprehensive list of all the topics you can get help on with 
ahelp.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SHUTDOWN<BR></EM>Although CoffeeMud can also be brought down 
by killing the Java virtual machine, the proper way to shut down CoffeeMud is by 
entering the shutdown command.&nbsp; This will ensure that all users are saved 
back to disk, and that the system goes down in a polite and orderly 
manner.&nbsp; This is also the command which should be used when changes are 
made to your "coffeemud.ini" file.&nbsp; Changes to your INI file do not take 
affect until your server is restarted.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SAVE<BR></EM>This command is used to update your CoffeeMud 
database. If you use "save user",&nbsp;the system will&nbsp;update the players 
data.&nbsp; "save room" can make aspects of&nbsp;a room permanent by saving it 
to the database.&nbsp; Saving rooms is discussed further below in the section on 
building.</P>
<P align=left><EM>LIST<BR></EM>The Archon is able to list lots of different 
things, for many different reasons.&nbsp; "list users" will show you all of the 
players, and when they logged on last.&nbsp; This is useful for weeding out olde 
players (see DESTROY below).&nbsp; "list sessions" will show you a list of all 
active players.&nbsp; "list threads" will show you how many Java threads are 
active.&nbsp; "list ticks" will show you all the objects making use of those 
threads! "list reports" will who you your resource usage.&nbsp; You may also 
list things like locales, items, weapons, armor, mobs, and other things 
discussed further down in the sections on world building.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SYSMSGS<BR></EM>This important little trick is vital to those doing 
CoffeeMud development from the command line. It gives the Archon a unique vision 
of the world sometimes necessary for his work.&nbsp; For one, it makes 
everything visible to the Archon regardless of its state of visibility, 
darkness, fog, or any/all other conditions.&nbsp; It also reveals the unique 
identifying codes, classes, and names by which things are known or 
identified.&nbsp; All of this is very important when trying to modify or destroy 
things you no longer want in your world.</P>
<P align=left><EM>WIZINV<BR></EM>Sometimes an Archon wants a little privacy, and this 
command gives it to him or her.&nbsp; It will make the Archon completely 
undetectable, allowing free movement without harassment from players or 
monsters.</P>
<P align=left><EM>TAKE<BR></EM>Use this command if a player or monster has something 
that doesn't belong to them, and you need it back.</P>
<P align=left><EM>POSSESS<BR></EM>Easily the most fun part of being an Archon is to 
possess one of the monsters and harass the players, making them think the 
monsters have truely come to life!&nbsp; Some enjoy this so much that they 
forget to return to their true bodies!</P>
<P align=left><EM>ORDER<BR></EM>Although any player may order around their followers, 
an Archon can order ANYONE to do ANYTHING.</P>
<P align=left><EM>BEACON<BR></EM>The beacon command is used to change the unique home, 
start room, or recall room of either the Archon, or some targeted player.&nbsp; 
Rarely used, it is typically invoked only as reward for&nbsp;a player or perhaps 
a lesser admin.</P>
<P align=left><EM>BOOT<BR></EM>If a player becomes troublesome, or you just want them 
to go away, you will use this power to knock them temporarily out of your mud, 
regardless of where they are in your world.&nbsp; To make them STAY away, you 
will have to investigate commands such as destroy or ban.</P>
<P align=left><EM>GOTO<BR></EM>Allows the Archon to zap him or herself directly to 
the room or mob of his or her choice.&nbsp; The argument is a valid Room ID, 
room name, mob name, or area name.&nbsp; You will find yourself using the goto 
command quite a bit.&nbsp; Walking everywhere sucks.</P>
<P><EM>TRANSFER<BR></EM>Allows the Archon to zap&nbsp;someone directly to the 
room or mob of his or her choice.&nbsp; The argument is either ALL or the name 
of the target, and a valid Room ID, room name, mob name, or area name.&nbsp; Use 
this when you want someone to go somewhere NOW.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SNOOP<BR></EM>This command can let you watch other players as they 
wander your world.&nbsp; This command gives you a second pair of eyes to look 
over the shoulder of the player of your choice.&nbsp; You will see everything 
they see, almost as if you were them yourself.</P>
<P align=left><EM>WHERE<BR></EM>Allows the Archon to who all is online, and where they 
are on the map. An argument, such as "where orc",&nbsp;may be given to specify a 
specific mob name.&nbsp; That way, you can find out where you might have 
misplaced that wandering zombie.</P>
<P align=left><EM>UNLOAD<BR></EM>If you've made any changes to your help files or other 
resources, and don't want to have to reboot the whole MUD, you can use this 
command as a short-cut.&nbsp; It unloads "resources" (try "list resources") that 
are in memory.&nbsp; By unloading resources from memory, you force CoffeeMud to 
reload your changes from disk.</P>
<P align=left><EM>RESET<BR></EM>Giving a parameter of "room" or "area", this command 
will make everything reset back to the state it was last saved at.</P>
<P align=left><EM>EXPORT<BR></EM>If you need a backup to your database, you can save 
your areas one at a time as files, for reimportation in the event of a 
disaster.&nbsp; This command will generate files with the extension 
.cmare.&nbsp; They are XML formatted text files containing all the data you told 
the system to export.&nbsp; In addition to rooms and areas, you can also 
specifically export some items or mobs from a room.&nbsp; The import command 
could then be used later to load the data you exported back in.</P>
<P align=left><EM>IMPORT<BR></EM>Import will suck in one or more data files and 
recreate rooms, areas, mobs, items, and lots of other stuff from the contents of 
those files.&nbsp;&nbsp;The data files that import will successfully 
read&nbsp;include (of course) the CoffeeMud .cmare files discussed under the 
export command.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, import&nbsp;will also take in area 
data&nbsp;files from other MUDs, such as ROM, CircleMUD, and others.&nbsp; Of 
the non-CoffeeMud area files, the ROM format is by far the best supported.</P>
<P align=left><EM>MERGE<BR></EM>This powerful tool is rarely used, but is vital if you 
need to make small changes to&nbsp;identical items or mobs scattered all around 
your world.&nbsp; It uses item or mob data gathered from the&nbsp;export command 
to merge with the&nbsp;items and mobs you specify in the real world, making the 
necessary world corrections&nbsp;&nbsp;that you want it to.</P>
<P align=left><EM>CREATE<BR></EM>Depending on the argument, this command can bring 
almost anything into existence, from rooms to doors, from monsters to 
items.&nbsp; The create command is discussed at length in the sections on 
building rooms and areas.</P>
<P align=left><EM>COPY<BR></EM>Depending on the argument, this command can make 
copies of almost anything in your mud, from rooms to monsters and items.&nbsp; 
The thing you want to copy must exist somewhere in the world for you to properly 
copy it.&nbsp; You can even specify how many things you wish to copy, for those 
moments when one pot pie just won't do.</P>
<P align=left><EM>MODIFY<BR></EM>If something which exists is not quite right, this 
command can make it right.&nbsp; By telling the system exactly what you want to 
modify, you can change it into what it ought to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modify 
command is discussed&nbsp;further in the sections on building rooms and 
areas.</P>
<P align=left><EM>DESTROY<BR></EM>Last but not least, this powerful command can be used 
to banish objects and mobs, rooms and areas, or even players -- 
permanently.&nbsp;A&nbsp; player (user) need not be online to be destroyed. The 
destroy command, as it relates to rooms, exits, items, and mobs,&nbsp;is 
discussed&nbsp;further in the sections on building rooms and areas.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left><EM>GENCHAR<BR></EM>This little tool accepts a character class name and a 
level, and it shows you the stats of an "average" player of that class and 
level.&nbsp; Although it's not a vital administration tool, CharGen can be a 
helpful aid in the construction of monsters, perhaps.</P>
<P align=left><EM>DUMPFILE<BR></EM>When you want to view some text file on 
your&nbsp;computer through the MUD.</P>
<P align=left><EM>ANNOUNCE<BR></EM>If there is some message you wish to give to everyone 
presently on your mud, this is the surest way to make sure they receive it.</P>
<P align=left><EM>TICKTOCK<BR></EM>This simple little power will advance the world's time 
clock by one hour every time it is used.&nbsp; If it's day, and you want it to 
be night, or vis-versa, this is the way to go.</P>
<P align=left><EM>BAN<BR></EM>Deadly, but necessary, this command allows you to 
specify player names, or partial player names, or IP addresses or IP ranges that 
you wish to keep OUT of your mud.</P>
<P><EM>I3<BR></EM>This module is used to manage InterMud 3 chatting 
channels.&nbsp; I3 is a component of CoffeeMud that provides for chatting 
channels which span across many many muds in cyperspace, allowing players and 
admins to talk to folks playing on other muds.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=red 
size=5>Security</FONT></STRONG> </P>
<P align=left>CoffeeMud has three security levels built 
into it: the Archon, the Area SubOp, and the player.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>The Archon has access to all commands above, 
and rights to use them anywhere in the world.&nbsp; The Archon has rights to all 
the functions of the MUDGrinder, and the power to enforce any rule.&nbsp; The 
Archon is all powerful.&nbsp; Archons are defined as any player with the 
Character Class called "Archon".&nbsp; Archons can be created by having OTHER 
Archons modifying them and making their current class Archon.&nbsp; Archons can 
also be created by reading from the Manual of the Archons, which is an item that 
can be created at will by an Archon.</P>
<P align=left>The Area SubOp (also called an Area Archon) 
is a&nbsp;player with limited rights and powers within a single Area of the 
world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the full Archon, an Area SubOp may be any class.&nbsp; 
While residing in an Area that has designated the player as an Area SubOp, the 
player has access to the all of the commands and powers of the Archon EXCEPT: 
ban, dumpfile, import, export, load, merge, ticktock, unload, and wizinv. Area 
SubOps are also unable to see hidden areas, see the unseen (wizinv, nondetection 
etc) people on the who list, destroy users, create the Manual of the Archons, 
the Archon Staff, or the Archon Wand, manage the I3 settings, write on 
disallowed journals, or access any MUDGrinder functionality aside from the 
management of their own areas.</P>
<P align=left>Players are just players, and are unable to 
wipe their own noses without an Archon to provide them a tissue.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5>Building Your World: Planning is the First 
Step</FONT></P></STRONG>
<P>Before a single bird can flitter through the skies that 
you opened up, you must have planned the placement of that sky, and the song of 
that bird.&nbsp; I am assuming you have been given some general area to 
construct, some wicked kingdom, joyous elven city by the sea, or some other such 
nonsense.&nbsp; If not, get one; decide on the general theme of some area you 
wish to construct.</P>
<P>At this point I suggest you&nbsp;get a piece of graph 
paper or parchment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon it you shall draw small squares next 
to each other.&nbsp; Plot out every location you will create.&nbsp; The squares 
need not be equal in size, but they need to all fit together somehow.&nbsp; 
Before invoking the spells of creation, you should know where every door leads, 
where every path ends, and if X indeed marks the spot, where the X is.<BR><BR>Inside each square, you shall make 
small notes.&nbsp; What notes?&nbsp; Well, that's the next part of our 
story.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5>Understanding Rooms</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>At the foundation of the CoffeeMud world is the 
room.&nbsp; Now, a room is not just some pink wallpapered play area, but simply 
a place.&nbsp; Certainly a kitchen can be a room, as can a pink wallpapered play 
area, but so can the bottom of a well, a stretch of rolling hills, the top of a 
tall mountain, or a dragon’s lair deep underground.&nbsp; Physical size does not 
matter with rooms; only your imagination can determine that.</P>
<P>Every room has a general foundational type that defines 
it.&nbsp; That type determines the behavior of that room day to day, whether it 
is outside or inside, made of wood or stone, a mountain or a plain, in darkness 
or light, a cliffside or deep in the ocean.&nbsp; The type determines whether 
one breathes water or air,&nbsp;chops wood or fishes, and how good the hunting 
is.&nbsp; This foundational type of every room has a name: Locale.&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you log into CoffeeMud right now, you can list the 
available Locales with the command "list locales".&nbsp; This list should 
include many different types of locales, most of which are 
self-explanatory.&nbsp; They include:</P>

<P><BR>For each room you are drawing 
on your graph parchment, you should note in the Locale type of the room from the 
above list, or from the list you received when you entered "list locales" into 
CoffeeMud.&nbsp; Keep in mind that some rooms are multi-rooms.&nbsp; These Grids 
and Mazes represent 2-Dimensional grids of rooms of a single sort.&nbsp; The 
dimensions are entirely up to you, and can range from a thin 1x20 trail, to a 
wide 15x15 block.&nbsp; The mazes expand on this by creating weaving paths 
through the grids.</P>
<P>The detailed properties of rooms are discussed further 
in the section on creating rooms.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5>Understanding Exits</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Now surely you did not expect everyone to conjure him or 
herself from place to place!&nbsp; Why, the pitiful halfling thieves would 
starve in their holes if this were so.&nbsp; No, each of the rooms you have 
drawn on your paper will be connected with things called Exits.</P>
<P>For any two rooms that one can travel between, there are 
always two exits.&nbsp; One exit leads from the first room to the second. 
Another exit leads from the second room to the first.&nbsp; Usually those exits 
are the same, but they need not be if you don't want them to be so.</P>
<P>All exits will take a person from one room to another, 
and may even take them back again if you choose.&nbsp; An exit can only be 
located in one of six directions: North, South, East, West, Up, and Down.&nbsp; 
The four compass directions are easy to fathom, but be careful with up and down, 
as they need not be unhindered flight, or a reckless fall.&nbsp; If, for 
instance, the destination room is a Locale like "InTheAir", then Up obviously 
represents the open sky.&nbsp; If it is another "StoneRoom", however, it 
probably represents a flight of stairs.&nbsp; The Down direction may represent 
falling off a cliff, but it may also represent a ladder down to the 
basement.&nbsp; Either way is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Exits, like rooms, can be of many different types.&nbsp; 
If you are still in CoffeeMud, enter the command "list exits".&nbsp; The list 
you receive describes the many connectors that can be mixed and matched between 
rooms.&nbsp; Some include doors, and some include doors with locks.&nbsp; There 
are walkways with pits, doors with needle traps, and many others.&nbsp; By far 
the most common of these Exits is called "Open".&nbsp; It describes a completely 
free and clear path between the two rooms you are creating.&nbsp; Here is the 
official list:</P>

<P>As you finish your graph parchment drawing, be sure to 
note those places where there are doors, locked doors, pit traps, and open 
walkways.&nbsp; If a door is one way, or if a door leads to one place when one 
enters, but does not go back to there when one leaves, make a note of that 
too.</P>
<P>However, it may come to pass that there is a rickety 
straw door to some hut you wish to have, but it was not listed among your 
choices.&nbsp; Fear not, for there is "GenExit".&nbsp; "GenExit" stands for 
"Generic Exit", and represents the finest in Archon power.&nbsp; A completely 
customizable exit flowing from one room to another.&nbsp; GenExits, as well as 
the other features of exits, are discussed further in the section on creating 
exits.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG><FONT 
color=purple size=5>Understanding That Which Creepeth Upon 
the Land</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The denizens of your land are surely the greatest 
accomplishment you will claim.&nbsp; From the lowly cooks in your kitchens to 
the great beasts in the darkest dungeons, it is they who will be remembered by 
those who visit your realm.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Funny then that for things so important, they should have 
such a short, ugly sounding name: MOB.&nbsp; If you are in CoffeeMud, you can 
list them: "list mobs".&nbsp; It will show you every creature that can populate 
your cities, dwell in your dungeons, or hide in your pantries.&nbsp; They are 
too numerous to list here. </P>
<P>If a creature is not listed there that you require, there 
is always the GenMob, that nasty formless being that can be shaped by the Archon 
to appear and behave exactly as it should.&nbsp; GenShopkeepers and 
GenBankers&nbsp;are&nbsp;available to provide valuable services for your 
community.&nbsp; GenDeitys give your Clerics employment. GenRideable mobs 
provide transport.&nbsp; For more devious spirits, however, the GenUndead is 
also available, to strike fear in the hearts of the purest cleric.</P>
<P>GenMobs, as well as the features of MOBs, are discussed 
further in the section on creating MOBs.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5>The Things We Treasure</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Our last planning topic is that of the items that will be 
found in your land.&nbsp; Some of them will be priceless once-in-a-lifetime 
creations.&nbsp; Others will be reoccurring trapped chests that always seem to 
have enough gold for those bold enough to continuously risk their guardians.</P>
<P>The items can be discovered using the "list items" 
command.&nbsp; Other items include weapons, which can be discovered through 
"list weapons", armor from "list armor", and other miscellaneous enchanted items 
through "list magic".&nbsp; </P>
<P>For those items you need by are not present, there is 
also the "GenItem",&nbsp;"GenBoat", "GenChair", "GenBed", "GenCoins", 
"GenCorpse", "GenKey", "GenLantern", "GenLightSource", 
"GenMap",&nbsp;&nbsp;"GenResource", "GenLiquidResource", "GenFoodResource", 
"GenRideable", "GenWallpaper", "GenJournal", "GenContainer", "GenFood", 
"GenWater", and "GenReadable".&nbsp; For the fighting spirit there is the 
"GenWeapon", "GenStaff", and "GenArmor".&nbsp; Among the&nbsp;formless magical 
items are "GenPill", "GenPotion", "GenScroll", "GenWand", and 
"GenSuperPill".&nbsp; These and the many properties of items are discussed below 
under the section on creating items.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5>The Art of Creation</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Before beginning, you should log into CoffeeMud and take 
yourself to some place that is adjacent to the area you will be forming.&nbsp; 
You should also cast the spell of natural enlightenment using the following 
command: "sysmsgs".&nbsp; You should see an utterance that reads "Extended 
messages are now: ON".&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now your eyes will behold new wonders when you look 
around the rooms:&nbsp; You will see the Locale types of the room, the Room IDs 
that have been assigned uniquely to each room, the Area IDs of the area you are 
in.&nbsp; They should look like this:</P>
<P>Area&nbsp; :(MyArea)<BR>Locale: 
(StoneRoom)&nbsp; <BR>(MyArea#123) Joe Bob's Room</P>
<P>The first line lists the area name, the second line the 
locale type we talked about earlier, and the&nbsp;third line lists the Room ID, 
followed by the Room Name.&nbsp; Take note of them all, my friend, and learn to 
appreciate their beauty.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Creating Rooms</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Now that you have your plan laid out, it is quite time to 
being execution.&nbsp; Gather your strength, and begin harnessing the power of 
the Archon, for you will need every ounce of it when the wood and rock chips 
start flying.</P>
<P>To create a new room most easily, you must first be 
standing in&nbsp;a room adjacent to it,&nbsp;one that will be connected to it 
through some exit.&nbsp; You will then utter the invocation of room creation, 
summoning the Locale in the direction that the new room should be.&nbsp; For 
instance, you wish to have a new room&nbsp;north of room "MyArea#123".&nbsp; If 
room&nbsp;"MyArea#123” is already created, and the new room&nbsp;is going to be 
of the "StoneRoom" Locale, you would bring yourself to room&nbsp;"MyArea#123" 
and utter the words:&nbsp; "create stoneroom north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createroom.gif" ></P>
<P>At this point, you should cover your ears, as the sound 
of a stone room falling to the north is often quite disturbing.&nbsp; Between 
the two rooms; the one you are standing in, and the one you have created, will 
be a default exit: the Open exit.&nbsp; Most times, that is ok, though changing 
it will be the subject of the next section.</P>
<P>However, once this is done, and the rooms are irrevocably 
linked, you can still throw a small twist on things.&nbsp; If you are still 
standing in room "MyArea#123" and wish to create a NEW StoneRoom in the SAME 
direction, it can be done.&nbsp; Uttering the words "create StoneRoom north" 
AGAIN and a new room is created.&nbsp; Now, what happened with "MyArea#124" 
you’re wondering?&nbsp; It is still there, and it still leads back to where you 
are standing -- a one way exit.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createroom2.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Creating and Modifying Areas</FONT> </STRONG></P>
<P>A town or village, country or demesnes can hardly come to 
be without the careful demarcation of their borders.&nbsp; What seperates the 
town from the country, or one country from another?&nbsp; Like everything else, 
this is the decision of the Archon as he groups his rooms into Areas.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The best way to create your areas is to do so right from 
the start.&nbsp; The moment you create the first plot of land in your new area, 
or lay down the first building in your new town, you should designate it as 
such.&nbsp; Enter the new room in your new area and utter the mystic chant 
"modify room area New Area Name".&nbsp; Of course, where "New Area Name" can be 
anything you wish.&nbsp; Call it "Newarea Land" or "Goldfish Villiage" or "The 
Fruity Phantasm" or whatever strikes your fancy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now that you have designated your new room as belonging 
to a new area, it is important to remember to create all future rooms 
by&nbsp;doing so from&nbsp;rooms that already belong to the new area.&nbsp; Any 
future rooms that you build by standing in your new area room will bear its area 
mark, as well as any rooms created from any other room bearing the new area 
mark.&nbsp; If you fail then, you may be forced to invoke the power of the 
"modify room area..." command again to re-group the rooms you are creating.<BR><BR>Areas also contain important 
properties which may be modified.&nbsp; Enter the secret code "modify area" to 
go through a list of these modifiable properties.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The&nbsp;<EM>name</EM> and <EM>description</EM> of the area may be changed by following the 
promptings.&nbsp; You may also tinker with the <EM>climate</EM> of your area, which will affect the types of 
weather that will blow through it, and how mild or severe the winters and 
summers may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also where you may add <EM>SubOps</EM>.&nbsp; A SubOp is a player who has (almost) 
Archon-like powers within areas you designate.&nbsp; Designate SubOps if 
creating a universe becomes a little bit too much work for one person.</P>
<P>Strange settings like <EM>Technology 
Level</EM> and <EM>Archive File Name</EM> are available on 
the area promptings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry about these.&nbsp; The former is 
not very important at the moment, and the second is a bit too obscure for these 
lessons.</P>
<P>You will also be asked to add any <EM>behaviors </EM>and <EM>affects</EM> to 
the&nbsp;area that you wish to.&nbsp; These may seem strange at first, and 
usually you won't add any of these at all.&nbsp; After all, rarely does a plot 
of dirt exibit any behavior, and what the heck is an affect?&nbsp; Well! To the 
first, the wind blowing through the trees, the hoot of an owl, or a distant 
cackling noise are all considerable behaviors.&nbsp; In fact, it is a behavior 
called "Emoter".&nbsp; Enter "ahelp emoter" for more information about the 
Emoter behavior.&nbsp; There are other behaviors that Areas may benefit from 
too. Here are some examples: </P>
<P>"FasterRoom" makes everything happen twice as fast here 
(or faster!)<BR>"Emoter" is what I mentioned above -- it's 
for inserting those cute little blurbs in the area.<BR>"Sounder" is also for inserting little blurbs, plus it 
reacts to player actions.<BR>"InstantDeath" makes everything 
that comes here DIE!!!!!<BR>"LinkedWeather" makes the 
weather in this area mimic the weather from another area.<BR>"PuddleMaker" will scatter some puddles around after rain or 
snow.<BR>"RandomMonsters" will populate the area with lots 
of hideously random creatures that you choose.<BR>"ResetWhole" will cause the whole area to re-boot every so 
often, thus supplementing the natural "rejuv" process.<BR>"WaterCurrents" will make those on the water bob and flow in 
the direction you specify. </P>
<P>As for affects, well, affects are special properties 
which you can attach to your new little holes in the ground.&nbsp; There are 
lots of nice properties that one may add to an&nbsp;Area, which will affect 
every room in it, such as: </P>
<P>"Prop_ReqNoMOB" to make your area a player-only place to 
be.&nbsp; <BR>"Prop_MagicFreedom" to fluster any spell-using 
folks that happen along.<BR>"Prop_NoChannel" for a place of 
quiet.<BR>"Prop_PeaceMaker" to go with it if you want peace 
AND quiet.&nbsp; <BR>"Prop_Hidden" will make the area 
unlisted to normal players.<BR>"Prop_NoTeleport" keeps those 
silly mages from teleporting in.<BR>"Prop_NoTeleportOut" 
keeps those silly mages IN. <BR>"Prop_EnlargeRoom" makes 
crossing the area eat up more Mana.<BR>"Prop_NoCharm" lets 
everyone remember who their REAL friends are.<BR>"Prop_NoRecall" keeps folks from taking the easy way out.<BR>"Prop_NoSummon" makes sure that everyone leaves of their own 
free will.<BR>"Prop_ReqAlignments" lets you limit the 
alignment of all who enter.<BR>"Prop_ReqCapacity" lets you 
limit the number of folks who may enter each room.<BR>"Prop_ReqClasses" lets you limit the character class of 
those who enter.<BR>"Prop_ReqEntry" lets you limit entry to 
folks by many different criteria.<BR>"Prop_ReqHeight" keeps 
out tall people, or at least those unwilling to crawl.<BR>"Prop_ReqLevels" lets you limit entry by levels.<BR>"Prop_ReqRaces" lets you limit entry by race.<BR>"Prop_PKill" makes this a place that only the bloodthirsty 
may enter.<BR>"Prop_NoPKill" keeps out the riffraff.<BR><BR>To learn more about the properties 
you can add to areas and rooms, enter "ahelp" while you are in CoffeeMud.&nbsp; 
Now, isn't this fun?&nbsp; Remember, if you make a mistake, fear not, for the 
land does not grow weary of your molding.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Modifying Rooms</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>For now, once you have created a new room, it is time to 
design the landscape of it.&nbsp; To do this, you should enter the room through 
the default Open exit that was created for you.&nbsp; You will find the room 
plain and boring.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To give the room a new name and description, utter the 
invocation: "modify room" and follow the promptings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <EM>display </EM>property is the&nbsp;short name that appears at 
the top of the room description, while the <EM>description 
</EM>field is the long text.&nbsp; Type whatever you like &nbsp;into these 
fields, and feel the power as the place takes on a new form dictated by your 
creative magic.&nbsp; You may insert line breaks using either %0D or \n.</P>
<P>Rooms of the Grid and Maze sort present unique challenges 
to the molder of universes.&nbsp; In the first place, if you have SYSMSGS turned 
on, you will notice that the room ID displayed is a little different.&nbsp; In 
addition to the room ID of the parent room, there is an additional set of 
parenthesis showing where you are in the big grid room.&nbsp; It would look 
something like this:</P>
<P>Area :(Coffee Grounds) <BR>Locale:(Plains) <BR>(Coffee 
Grounds#19#(0,2)) The Demitasse Demesnes</P>
<P>In this case, we are in Coffee Grounds#19, child room at 
X=0, Y=2.&nbsp;</P>
<P>You will notice that you are unable to modify child rooms 
like this one.&nbsp; In the case of Grids and Mazes, you must be inside the 
Parent room to perform modifications.&nbsp; To get to the parent room, use the 
GOTO command.&nbsp; In the example above, we would enter "goto Coffee 
Grounds#19".&nbsp; This will allow us to properly modify the room, and add any 
creatures (mobs) to it later on.</P>
<P>Once you are in the parent room of a Grid or Maze, you 
may use "modify room" to modify the properties of the entire grid or maze.&nbsp; 
You can modify things like the dimensions in the X and Y, to make your grid 
anything from a long hallway to a giant hedge maze.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Modifying the <EM>display&nbsp; 
</EM>and <EM>description </EM>fields also has unique 
consequences inside a Maze or Grid.&nbsp; You may enter a random selection of 
text strings to display into each of these fields, so long as you remember to 
seperate each individual text selection by the &lt;P&gt; string.&nbsp; For 
example:</P>
<P>Display: 'First Display Title&lt;P&gt;Second Display 
Title&lt;P&gt;Third Display Title'<BR>Description: 'First 
Description&lt;P&gt;Second Description&lt;P&gt;Third Description'</P>
<P>The above, when placed in a grid or maze locale, will 
cause CoffeeMud to select randomly among three different display 
title/description combinations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is an equal number of 
display and descriptions given (3), the display and titles will always be 
matched up in the grid children rooms.&nbsp; </P>
<P>After you have made your modifications to the grid parent 
room display and description, use the "reset room" command to have them take 
affect.</P>
<P>The "reset room" command will force CoffeeMud not only to 
reset a grid or maze, but to reload the creatures and items last saved in the 
CoffeeMud database.&nbsp; This can be useful if you make a few critters or 
things you don't want to keep and havn't yet saved.&nbsp; A corresponding "reset 
area" command does the same for the whole area.</P>
<P>And speaking of areas,&nbsp;rooms also may have behaviors 
and affects added to them, including a few more.&nbsp; In this case, the 
behaviors and affects above will only be active for this particular room. Aside 
from those listed under Areas above, here are additional Behaviors you might 
enjoy: </P>
<P>"DelayedTransporter" causes all those who enter to be 
whisked elsewhere.<BR>"Emoter" - yea -- this was mentioned 
under Areas, but it's just sooo cool.<BR>"Sounder" is still 
a good alternative to Emoter.<BR>"Mime"&nbsp;causes the room 
to mimic players.&nbsp; Wierd.. yea, I know.<BR>"MovingRoom" 
the fast train to somewhere.<BR>"ResourceOverride" if you 
want fishing in the desert, or sand in your swap, this is the way to go.<BR>Lots of other properties and affects are also available for 
rooms.&nbsp; In addition to all the ones listed above under Areas, here are a 
few more you might want to add: </P>
<P>"Prop_ClosedDayNight" turns off the lights in a lit room 
at nighttime.<BR>"Prop_ItemTransporter" drop it, and its 
gone -- elsewhere.<BR>"Prop_ItemReceiver" is the 
elsewhere.<BR>"Prop_LotsForSale" puts this room up for sale, 
and ensures that you never run out of new rooms to buy.<BR>"Prop_NarrowLedge" makes this a room you can cross.. if you 
are very very careful.<BR>"Prop_ReqTattoo" checks out a mobs 
forearm before letting them in.<BR>"Prop_RestrictSpells" 
shuts down a list of spells that you provide.<BR>"Prop_RoomDark" turns off the lights.<BR>"Prop_RoomForSale" puts this one little room on the 
market.<BR>"Prop_RoomsForSale" designates that this room, 
and all others like it nearby, are for sale as a group.<BR>"Prop_RoomView" makes this room seem to be another...<BR>"Prop_RoomWatch" allows folks in other rooms to watch what 
goes on here.<BR>"Prop_SparringRoom" makes the consequences 
of death more palatable.<BR>"Prop_SpellAdder" puts everyone 
who enters under its spell.<BR>"Prop_TattooAdder" 
puts&nbsp;a little something on all who enter.<BR>"Prop_Transporter" send those who enter to the room you 
designate.<BR>"Prop_Trashcan" destroys stuff dropped on the 
ground.<BR>"Prop_WeakBridge" makes cross this room very very 
dangerous.<BR>"Spell_Silence" to quiet things down.<BR>And lots and lots of traps to put in your rooms: 
"Thief_Caltrops", "Thief_DeathTrap", "Thief_Listen", "Thief_MinorTrap", 
"Thief_Trap", "Trap_AcidPit", "Trap_Avalanche", "Trap_BearTrap", 
"Trap_Boulders", "Trap_CaveIn", "Trap_CrushingRoom", "Trap_Darkfall", 
"Trap_DeepPit", "Trap_Enter", "Trap_EnterBlade", "Trap_EnterGas", 
"Trap_EnterNeedle", "Trap_EnterSpell", "Trap_FloodRoom", "Trap_MonsterCage", 
"Trap_RatPit", "Trap_RoomPit", "Trap_SnakePit", "Trap_Snare", "Trap_SpikePit", 
"Trap_Tripline". </P>
<P>Ok! Back to work! </P>
<P>If you are ever wandering around, and wish to go directly 
to a room you have created, you may utter the magic matra "goto RoomID".&nbsp; 
For instance, entering "goto MyArea#123" would take you to the room we created 
above.&nbsp; This will especially come in handy when we begin to create and 
destroy the links between rooms, and there is no other way to get to a room. 
</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Linking Two Rooms Together</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Now that&nbsp;you have created a room, and wish to link 
one of the rooms in your area with one of another, you can use a command that 
utilizes the Room IDs mentioned above.&nbsp; If you would like to create a 
northerly link from room "MyArea#123" to a room whose room ID is "MyArea#124", 
then you need only stand in room "MyArea#123" (use the "goto" command if you 
must), and utter the invocation:&nbsp; "link MyArea#124 north".&nbsp; This will 
create an Open exit between the room you are standing in, and the room whose ID 
is born out.&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/linkroom.gif" ></P>
<P>You should note that this command could be used as it was 
in the last section to create one-way exits to existing rooms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Unlinking Two Rooms</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>If you wish to detach two rooms from each other, you need 
only learn the "unlink" command.&nbsp; If you are standing in the room to the 
south of the one you wish to unlink, and the room you wish to detach from is to 
the north, utter the command: "unlink north".&nbsp; It will do the trick!</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyroom.gif" ></P>
<P>Keep in mind that just because there is no longer a route 
from the room you are in to the other via a northerly path, it does not mean 
that there is no path from the detached room back to here again.&nbsp; You may 
have to conjure yourself into the&nbsp;other place and enter a "unlink south" 
command to completely detach them forever.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Destroying a Room</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Sometimes the pain born from a failed or evil place is 
too much to bear, and as an Archon, you can do something about it.&nbsp; This 
involves the destroy command.&nbsp; It does not merely unlink the room, but 
obliterates it altogether and forever.&nbsp; To do this, first make sure you are 
not standing in the room you wish to destroy.&nbsp; Such destructive magic would 
surely be your end as well.&nbsp; Then you must utilize the Room ID of the 
doomed place.&nbsp; If the room you wish to destroy has the Room ID of 
"MyArea#124", then enter:&nbsp; "destroy MyArea#124".&nbsp; It will obliterate 
that place from the planet forever.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyroom2.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Creating Exits</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The difference between Exits and Rooms is a very 
important one.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Rooms describes <EM>WHETHER</EM> two rooms are connected, and by which 
direction.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Exits describes <EM>HOW</EM> one gets from one room to the next.&nbsp; Two rooms 
must be connected together before exits between them can be modified.</P>
<P>For instance, suppose you linked "MyArea#123" and 
"MyArea#124" as described above.&nbsp; By default, you get an StdOpenDoorway, 
also known as an "Open" exit.&nbsp; These exits can be walked through 
freely.&nbsp; Now suppose you wish to have a Door between the two rooms.&nbsp; 
If the exits between the two rooms are both the same, and you are standing in 
the southernmost room of the two, then changing them both is simply a matter of 
issuing the command "create Door north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createexit.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Destroying Exits</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Just as unlinking rooms disconnects them, destroying 
exits can SEEM to disconnect them.&nbsp; When you issue a simple destroy 
command, and refer specifically to the exit, then you will not be destroying the 
link between the two rooms, but merely the exit that travels between them.&nbsp; 
Archons can still travel through these missing links, but players will not be 
able to.&nbsp; Also, destroying an exit only deletes the exit in one direction, 
not both.&nbsp; For instance, if you are standing in the southerly room of two 
linked rooms that both have Exits between them, and you issue the command 
"destroy exit north", you will destroy the Open exit between the rooms.&nbsp; As 
an Archon, you can still travel north through the destroyed exit, but players 
will not be able to.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit.gif" ></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, that an exit has been deleted, it is possible to 
create a DIFFERENT kind of exit for the northerly direction from MyArea#123 to 
MyArea#124.&nbsp; Issuing a create command like "create Door north" will create 
a door that leads from MyArea#123 to MyArea#124, WITHOUT AFFECTING the Open path 
from MyArea#124 to MyArea#123.&nbsp; This is only possible when the exits 
between two rooms are different, or one is deleted, as is our case here.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit3.gif" ></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, suppose you wanted to have the same Door going 
between two rooms.&nbsp; For sure this is a more common scenario than the 
example we just went through.&nbsp; To do this, you must first delete BOTH of 
the exits between two rooms as described above. That means entering MyArea#123 
and entering "destroy exit north", and then entering MyArea#124 and entering 
"destroy exit south".&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit2.gif" ></P>
<P>Now, with both exits deleted (and thus the same), you can 
create a single door between them as we did in the first part of this section 
using the "create Door south" command.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createexit2.gif" ></P>
<P><BR><STRONG><FONT

<P>To modify an exit that is east of your present location,

bring one of these things into the world, you have only to call its true name 
using the create command.&nbsp; To create a Longsword, for instance, issue the 
command "create Longsword".&nbsp; It will then fall from the sky onto the floor 
or ground before you.</P>
<P><STRONG>The "GenItem", "GenCoins", 
"GenResource", "GenMirror", and "GenReadable"</STRONG></P>

represents a pile of gold coins, ready to be picked up and coverted to 
money.&nbsp; GenResource is a raw material, like iron, coal, or wood, from which 
other things are made.&nbsp; GenReadables are GenItems with something to read on

to another player, the property changes ownership.&nbsp; Although titles can be 
created by archons and given to shopkeepers to sell, the usual method for 
putting land up for sale is to create a shopkeeper of the type LANDSELLER (see

<P>There are properties of items, armor, weapons, and

<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Destroying Items</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>To destroy an item that is either being held by you, or 
is in the same room as you, you need only issue the destroy command.&nbsp; For 
instance, if a dagger has offended: "destroy item dagger" wll make it go 
away.</P>
<P>Once destroyed, items that have been set to rejuv will 
not do so.&nbsp; If the item was a permanently saved item in the room, you must

<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Tools of the Trade</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The Archons of your realm have lots of items that assist 
them in building and administering their mud.&nbsp; Lets take a look at 
these:</P>
<P><EM>The Archon Staff</EM>&nbsp; 
(CREATE ITEM ARCHONSTAFF) - the Archon Staff is the main tool of the true 
Archon.&nbsp; Also available from the OUTFIT command, it not only provides a 
deadly weapon, but a useful source of magical power.&nbsp; To use the powers of 
the staff, it must first be wielded.&nbsp; It is a two-handed item, so the 
Archon's held position must be given up for it as well.&nbsp; Once wielded, 
numerous magical words invoke the power: s<EM>ay "refresh" 
targetname</EM> will rejuvinate the targets mana, hit points, and movement; <EM>say "level up" targetname </EM>will give the target a free 
level of experience; <EM>say "level all up" targetname 
</EM>will level the target up to 30; <EM>say "burn" 
targetname </EM>will blast the target with hellish fire.</P>
<P><EM>The Wand of the Archons</EM> 
(CREATE ITEM WANDARCHON) - the Wand of the Archons is the one-handed alternative 
to the Archon Staff.&nbsp; It is also available only to true Archons.&nbsp; To 
use the powers of the wand, it must first be held. Once held, numerous magical 
words invoke the power: s<EM>ay "refresh" targetname</EM> 
will rejuvinate the targets mana, hit points, and movement; <EM>say "level up" targetname </EM>will give the target a free 
level of experience; <EM>say "level all up" targetname 
</EM>will level the target up to 30; <EM>say "burn" 
targetname </EM>will blast the target with hellish fire.</P>
<P><EM>The Goody Bag </EM>(CREATE ITEM 
GOODYBAG) - The Goody Bag is full of fabulous prizes which Archons may dispense 
to players.&nbsp; What's better, an item that is removed is always replaced, so 
that the bag never runs out.&nbsp; Inside the goody bad are sleeves with money 
notes, pills to gain stats or experience, and others goodies.</P>
<P><EM>Ingredients&nbsp;Sack&nbsp;</EM>(CREATE ITEM INGREDIENTS) - 
The Ingredients bag has exactly one of every kind of natural resource the system 
offers.&nbsp; Removing one from the bag will automatically replace it, so the 
bag never ever runs out.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Creating MOBs</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Greater even than the mages powerful spells of summoning 
is the Archons ability to conjure beasts into caverns and townspeople on to 
streets.&nbsp; To do this, the Archon need only issue the create command once 
again.&nbsp; Summoning a goblin into an ordinary room&nbsp;is as simple as 
entering "create Goblin".&nbsp; This will create a standard Goblin in the room 
you are standing in.&nbsp; To make him stay there, even after you reboot, you 
must save the room as described in the section below on saving rooms.</P>
<P>If&nbsp;you wish to create your goblin a Grid-type 
locale, extra consideration is required.&nbsp; Locale types like MountainsGrid, 
WoodsGrid, WoodsMaze, PlainsGrid, DesertMaze, etc.. can all contain nasty 
monsters in them.&nbsp; However, two rules need to be followed for this magic to 
work properly.&nbsp; The first is that you can only save&nbsp;creatures which 
are in the parent Grid room itself.&nbsp; If you have SYSMSGS on, you can tell 
which room this is because it is the only one with a simple room ID 
("MyArea#123") in the description.&nbsp;Since no one ever actually walks into 
the parent Grid room, the only way to get to it&nbsp;is using the Archon GOTO 
command.&nbsp; The second of the two rules is that you must give the mob a 
Mobile behavior.&nbsp; The mobile behaviors&nbsp;are specially coded so 
that&nbsp;they will take the&nbsp;monster to a random room inside the grid the 
first time the thing tries to move.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>The "GenMob"&nbsp;and 
"GenUndead"</STRONG></P>
<P>Whenever a GenMob&nbsp;or GenUndead is created, much like 
the GenItem above, you are presented with a list of properties to fill in.&nbsp; 
Pressing enter will leave the property unchanged.&nbsp; The only difference 
between the GenMob and GenUndead is that the GenUndead can be&nbsp;TURNed by a 
Cleric, while a GenMob cannot.&nbsp;&nbsp;The properties include:</P>

  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Level </EM></TD>
    <TD>this represents the experience level of the 
      MOB.&nbsp; This number determines (along with alignment) how much 
      experience a player will get for slaying the creature.&nbsp; This number 
      should be calculated with great care so as not to make it "too good" for a 
      higher level, or "too tough" for a lower level.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Attacks/Round</EM></TD>
    <TD>this represents the number of attacks the creature 
      receives every round.&nbsp;&nbsp;1 is perfect.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Attack Adjustment</EM></TD>
    <TD>this represents the MOBs ability to slay other 
      beings.&nbsp; At first level, this should be a 0.&nbsp; At 25th level, 
      this may be as much as 150-200.&nbsp; You should keep the default, either 
      way.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Damage/Hit</EM></TD>
    <TD>this represents the maximum amount of damage a MOB 
      does when striking its opponents.&nbsp; At first level, 4-8 is 
      plenty.&nbsp; At 25th level, 20-50 is a good range, depending upon the 
      monsters speed.&nbsp; Just keep the default.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Armor </EM></TD>
    <TD>the amount of protection the beast has against 
      being hit.&nbsp; Lower numbers are always better here.&nbsp; At first 
      level, 50 is a well-protected creature, while 100 is one that is 
      completely helpless against attacks.&nbsp; At 25th level, -150 would be a 
      good number.&nbsp; Again, just keep the default.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Hit Points/Level</EM></TD>
    <TD>this is a multiplier used to determine the 
      creatures hit points.&nbsp; The number 11 is a typical, it is the default, 
      and unless the creature is really nasty (12-20 range), it should be kept 
      at default.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Alignment </EM></TD>
    <TD>aside from the creatures experience level, this is 
      the most important determinate of whether a player gets experience for 
      killing it.&nbsp; You should make the alignment reflect the creature’s 
      obvious disposition.&nbsp; Making children evil, or a good orc doesn't do 
      anyone any good.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Money</EM></TD>
    <TD>unless a thief gets it first, this will be the 
      amount of money the creature is carrying.&nbsp; At first level, the number 
      10 is plenty.&nbsp; Again, follow the default.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Weight </EM></TD>
    <TD>You should make this number reflect the monsters

      them.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;may also, from a normal prompt, 
      enter&nbsp;'ahelp' for more information on the available behaviors.&nbsp; 
      Either way, you may add new ones by entering the behaviors proper names 
      here, followed by any behavior parameters.&nbsp; Entering it again will 
      remove it.&nbsp; If you gave your MOB any spells or skills, you should at 
      least also give it the CombatAbilities behavior so that it will use them 
      in combat.&nbsp; However, some behaviors, such as Mageness, Clericness, 
      etc.. come fully-loaded with abilities.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Affects</EM></TD>
    <TD>This may refer to a property, as discussed above 
      in the section on rooms, or it may refer to a permanent spell 
      effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it is one thing to be able to pray for 
      Bless, but quite another thing to ALWAYS be blessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either 
      way,&nbsp;use 'list' here to see the proper names of the abilities that 
      can be added as affects.&nbsp; Enter the proper name of the ability to add 
      it as an affect, then any affect parameters.&nbsp; Enter the proper name 
      again to remove it.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the main prompt, 'help properties' is 
      a great place to find the many mob properties available.&nbsp; 'help

<P>The "GenShopKeeper"</P></STRONG>
<P>ShopKeepers are folks that buy and sell equipement that 
is given to them by Archons.&nbsp; ShopKeepers can sell anything from items to 
creatures, skills as a teacher, or spells for a price.&nbsp; </P>
<P>ShopKeepers designated as Land Sellers will sell any 
rooms in the same area as the shopkeeper which has the Prop_RoomForSale, 
Prop_RoomsForSale, or Prop_LotsForSale properties.&nbsp; Use "AHELP 
Prop_RoomForSale" for more information on this affect you may add to 
rooms.&nbsp; ShopKeepers designated as Clan Land Sellers will do the same, but 
only for Clan members.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, players and clans can buy and 
own their own rooms where their property will be safe during reboots, and pets 
can become permanent fixtures.&nbsp; This is also the way the Construction, 
Masonry, Locksmith, and other property-related skills can become useful.</P>
<P>ShopKeepers can also be Inn Keepers.&nbsp; To make this 
work, you need only give the shopkeeper a number of StdInnKey items equal to the 
number of rooms in your inn.&nbsp; For each room in your inn, make sure you have 
a locked door for each room, and that each of the locked doors in your inn has a 
key code equal to "INN1", "INN2", etc.. up to the number of locked doors for 
each room in the Inn.&nbsp; Players will then buy the keys to rooms, and the 
keys will automatically return to the shopkeepers stock after a single mud 
"day".&nbsp; The only other trick to making a successful inn is to make sure you 
do the "reset room" command to the room with the innkeeper in it, after the keys 
have all been given to him, and the room has been saved.</P>
<P>ShopKeepers are much more savvy about money and economy 
than most.&nbsp; They will often draw not only from the loose gold a player has, 
but any high-denomination Notes the player has in his or her inventory.&nbsp; 
The ShopKeeper will also give change in this manner.&nbsp; The player will often 
need to check the "change bag" newly arrived in their inventory to see the 
change that a ShopKeeper might have given them.&nbsp; These change bags will 
often contain the high-denomination notes mentioned before (such as a Golden 
Note, or a Half Note).&nbsp; Each of these notes are convertable into loose gold 
merely by GETting them from the change bag.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Whenever a GenShopKeeper is created, much like the GenMob 
above, you are presented with a list of properties to fill in.&nbsp; Pressing 
enter will leave the property unchanged.&nbsp; The properties include all of the 
fields listed above under GenMob, plus&nbsp;a few more:</P>

    <TD><EM>Prejudice Factors</EM></TD>
    <TD>
      <P>This complicated field is where you can adjust the 
      prices the ShopKeeper sells from the programmed normal.&nbsp; An 
      unspecified value here will always return a value of 1.0 (which means NO 
      adjustment).&nbsp; However, you may enter one or more adjustments 
      seperated by semicolons (;).&nbsp; Here is an example:</P>
      <P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2 
      >SELL=5.5 Elf Dwarf ; BUY=0.4 Elf Dwarf ; SELL=1.0 ; 
      BUY=1.0</FONT></P>
      <P>Each adjustment must begin with the words "SELL=" 
      or "BUY=" followed by a Real number designating the adjustment from 
      normal.&nbsp; A value above 1.0 will raise prices.&nbsp; A value below 1.0 
      (like 0.3 or 0.75) will lower prices.&nbsp; Values of 0.0 are NOT 
      allowed.&nbsp; If you need to all but not allow buying and selling, a 
      value of 0.000000001 should do.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>Each adjustment may also contain the name of one or 
      more Racial Categories (Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfing, etc..).&nbsp; If a 
      Racial Category is specified, then the adjustment will ONLY apply to that 
      race.&nbsp; The adjustments are read from left to right, so adjustments 
      without any racial categories should be listed LAST.&nbsp; In the above 
      example, Dwarves and Elves are given a very bad deal, where everyone else 
      gets a normal one.&nbsp; In addition to Racial Categories, you may also 
      list alignments (good, neutral, or evil).&nbsp; Remember that this field 
      is evaluated from left to right, so any matches made&nbsp;on the left that 
      apply to a player will cancel evaluation of the rest of the 
      field!&nbsp;&nbsp; </P></TD></TR></TABLE></STRONG><BR></P><STRONG>
<P>The "GenBanker"</P></STRONG>
<P>A Banker is a special type of ShopKeeper that holds money 
and items in a special private account for players.&nbsp; Bankers can pay or 
charge interest on money left in the account, and charge interest on items left 
with them.&nbsp; A Banker may also be designated as a Clan Banker, meaning that 
it will only deal with Clan Treasurers.</P>

command to work, and add great role playing opportunities for all players, 
though especially Clerics, since only with deities does their Convert skill have 
any meaning.&nbsp; Since deities of this sort being attacked and killed can have 
a negative effect on game-play, it is important that deities be placed in a room 
where they will be save from players.&nbsp; Give the room where your deities are 
Prop_NoSummon and&nbsp;Prop_NoTeleport to keep&nbsp;mages from zapping deities

    <TD>This number represents an adjustment to the base

      color.&nbsp; For others, it may bring a slightly different 
      description.&nbsp; You can play with this value to see if it has any

    <TD>This number represents the number of ticks (4

      '0'&nbsp;means that the&nbsp;MOB never rejuvenates, but once killed, is 
      gone forever.&nbsp; Any other value will represent a number of 
      ticks.&nbsp; This property does not take effect until the room is 
      saved.&nbsp; For more information on making the RejuvTicks property take

<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Destroying MOBs</FONT></STRONG> </P>
<P>To destroy a MOB&nbsp;that is in the same room as you, 
you need only issue the destroy command.&nbsp;&nbsp;If an orc, for instance, no 
longer requires his existence: "destroy mob orc" will take that existence 
away.</P>
<P>Once destroyed, MOBs that have been set to rejuv will not 
do so.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;MOB was a permanently saved&nbsp;MOB in the room, you 
must re-save the room in order to make the MOBs destruction permanent.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5>Equipping MOBs</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>You may give a MOB equipment to wear or carry as 
treasure, if this is done properly.&nbsp; First off, you can ONLY equip a 
Generic MOB.&nbsp; This includes the GenMob, GenUndead, GenBanker, and 
GenShopKeeper.&nbsp; No other creature may be saved with equipment.&nbsp; 
Generic or non-Generic Items may be used as equipment.&nbsp; To equip the MOB, 
first create the items you wish to give to your new creature using the procedure 
described above under "Creating Items".&nbsp; Now, you may use the Archon 
"possess" skill to take temporary control of your monster, allowing them to pick 
up the items you created and wear or wield them as necessary.&nbsp; Another way 
is to "order" the mob to pick up the items you created, and then "order" them 
again to wear or wield the items.&nbsp; Either way will accomplish the 
purpose.<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT color=royalblue size=5>"Rejuvenating Items and Mobs" or "How to Save a 
Room"</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>MOBs and Items that are created in rooms, even those 
which have had the Rejuv Ticks property set to some reasonable number, will not 
actually begin to rejuvenate, and will not reappear in the room when CoffeeMud 
is rebooted, until the room is saved.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To save a room, you must be standing in it.&nbsp; From 
there, you may issue either the "save items" command to save the items in the 
room, "save mobs" command to save the mobs in the room, or "save room" to save 
them both.&nbsp; You should make sure that the items, mobs, or both, are exactly 
the way you want them to be when the system is rebooted.&nbsp; Players in the 
room, including yourself and your followers, will be ignored by the command to 
save the mobs.</P>
<P>Currently, the resets using the Rejuv setting method are 
on a mob-by-mob and item-by-item basis, though the system does give you some 
default reset times when mobs are created (based on level). There is an 
alternative reset method however.&nbsp; If you were to make NONE of your mobs or 
items resettable under the current scheme (by making the REJUV value 0), then 
to&nbsp;add&nbsp;the Behavior called "ResetWhole"&nbsp;to each&nbsp;Area, you 
can simply reset every room in the area on a timed basis.&nbsp;The behavior 
will&nbsp;reset every room after noone has visited the area in a certain amount 
of time. This time can be set in the behaviors parameters.&nbsp; Use AHELP 
ResetWhole for more information on this behavior. </P>

<P align=left><U>Weapon 
Groups</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When building weapons, you must first select the group that the weapon falls 
under.&nbsp; The weapon group affects which classes can use the weapon, as well 
as what specializations enhance it’s use.&nbsp; Selecting more common weapon 
groups, such as EDGED or SWORD can enable a weapon designer to place higher 
level restrictions, if desired, on the weapon.&nbsp; This increase in levels is 
suggested to be 2 additional levels, but not necessary to keep the game 
balanced.&nbsp; Weapons within a group may deal any TYPE of damage, as discussed 
later, but have general tendencies towards one or two types.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weapons within a given category have certain general tendencies, as describe by 
the table below.&nbsp; Any or all of these can be overridden for the purpose of 
weapon design, these are just the basic type of weapons in that category.&nbsp; 
For example, flailed weapons tend to be unwieldy (have a negative to attack), 
but that doesn’t mean all flails are unwieldy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Similarly, the allowed materials are materials used 
historically to make that type of weapon.&nbsp; If a weapon designer deigns to 
make a weapon out of LAMPOIL, it is doable, just a little unorthodox.&nbsp; (You 
would probably want to make the weapon out of GLASS, as that is the outer 
delivery devise of a Molotov Cocktail.)&nbsp; Currently, weapon SIZE has no 
effect on game play, but that may change at a later date.&nbsp; The BASE 
MATERIAL of a weapon assumes that weapons are made from that general area, and 
use material bonuses based on that type.&nbsp; If you create a weapon out of a 
non-standard, ALLOWABLE MATERIAL, use the appropriate charts for determining 
attack and damage bonuses after the level has been set.</P>

<P><U>Determining Weapon Level</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weapon creation can be done by the designer fixing the DAMAGE that a weapon 
does, or by fixing the LEVEL required to use the weapon.&nbsp; To generate 
weapons that do a specific amount of damage which are balanced with the 
WEAPONSMITHING skills, use the following formula:</P>
<P>Level= ((2*D)/(H+1) + (A-W)/5 +R)*((R/W)+2)+1</P>
<P>where</P>
<P>D=base DAMAGE of the weapon before material modifiers,<BR>H=number of hands required to wield<BR>A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<BR>R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<BR>W=WEIGHT of 
weapon</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Round the final number down, to a minimum level of 1.&nbsp; Some general 
criteria to follow for weapons to avoid creating ultra-powerful, low-level 
weapons include:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Create the weapon for a HUMAN-sized character first.&nbsp; If you wish to scale 
it up or down for different races, use the WEAPONS FOR GIANTS table after 
setting the base level.&nbsp; A typical one-handed human weapon will weigh from 
1-8 pounds, and a two handed weapon will typically weigh from 10 to 20 
pounds.&nbsp; Using heavier/lighter weapons will create a strange, and possibly 
unbalanced, result.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Melee weapons should not have a reach greater than 1.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weight of weapons should include any incidental weight in using the item, such 
as carrying case, ammunition, and other equipment generally assumed to be in use 
with the item.&nbsp; For most RANGED weapons, this will add another 4 pounds to 
the typical weight of the weapon.&nbsp; For melee weapons, the weight is 
generally negligible.&nbsp; (Except, possibly for a Katana with a very ornate 
scabbard.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Round the final number down, to a minimum level of 1.</P>

<P>Notice:&nbsp; On the Executioner’s Axe, and the Katana, 
the size does not correspond to the size formula given above.&nbsp; That’s OK, 
since the size isn’t currently used, and since the weapon designer ultimately 
has free reign over weapon design.&nbsp; Also, if you compare many of these 
levels to that of the weaponsmithing skill, you will some discrepancies on the 
levels.&nbsp; Weapon construction isn’t an exact science, as long as you get it 
in the general range the game will remain balanced.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If you wish to create a weapon based on the level of a MOB, you can use some 
algebra and convert the equation into a damage equation to give you the 
following formula: 
<P>D= ((L-1)/((R/W)+2) + (W-A)/5 -R)*((H+1)/2) 
<P>where 
<P>L=Level required to use weapon,<BR>H=number of hands required to wield<BR>A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<BR>R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<BR>W=WEIGHT of

<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
To compute the weapon’s base value use the following equation: 
<P>Cost of Item= 2*(W*V+(5*D+A+R*10)*D)/(H+1) 
<P>where 
<P>D=base DAMAGE of the weapon before material modifiers,<BR>H=number of hands required to wield<BR>A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<BR>R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<BR>W=WEIGHT of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weapon Damage Type is entirely up to the weapon designer, but some guidelines 
have already been provided for the basic weapon types.&nbsp; Here is a brief 
description of the different damage types, and level modifiers for weapons with 
these damage types: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
NATURAL—All Natural weapons should be UnGettable.&nbsp; Natural weapons are 
available for a creature to use in combat, such as a Manticore’s tail spikes; 
but not actual weapons for adventurer’s to loot.&nbsp; Any GETTABLE Natural 
weapon should have a level MODIFIER of at LEAST it’s DAMAGE rating.&nbsp; 
Natural weapons would be favored by monks if they could get them. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
SLASHING—Slashing weapons are fairly common and include things like Axes and 
Swords.&nbsp; No special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal 
SLASHING damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
PIERCING—Piercing weapons are very common amongst the Polearm groups.&nbsp; No 
special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal PIERCING 
damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
BASHING—Bashing weapons are common amongst Blunt and Hammer weapon groups.&nbsp; 
No special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal SLASHING 
damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
BURNING—This is the damage type for all fire based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Burning weapons tend to do more damage to cloth and leather armors, and overall 
are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there infrequent use 
amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base LEVEL if it is of type 
BURNING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
BURSTING— This is the damage type for all Magic based attacks and spells. 
Bursting are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there 
infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base LEVEL if 
it is of type BURSTING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
SHOOT—This is the damage type of projectile missiles, such as Bows and 
Guns.&nbsp; It is very similar in nature to PIERCING.&nbsp; No special care 
needs to be considered when making a weapon deal SHOOT damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
FROSTING—This is the damage type for all Cold based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Frosting weapons tend to be more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base 
LEVEL if it is of type FROSTING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
GASSING—This is the damage type for all Gas based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Gassing weapons tend to be more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base 
LEVEL if it is of type GASSING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
MELTING—This is the damage type for all Acid based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Melting weapons tend to do more damage to armors, and overall are more powerful 
than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there infrequent use amongst 
weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base LEVEL if it is of type 
MELTING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
STRIKING—This is the damage type for all Electricity based attacks and 
spells.&nbsp; Striking weapons tend to do more damage to cloth and leather 
armors, and overall are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base 
LEVEL if it is of type STRIKING.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If you just want to guestimate a weapon’s level or damage, use the following 
formulas.&nbsp; They aren’t very accurate, and can create radically overbalanced 
weapons in the hands of players, but they are great for easy NON-GETTABLE MOB 
weapons. 
<P>LEVEL=DAMAGE + (ATTACK/5) 
<P>or</P>
<P>DAMAGE=LEVEL - (ATTACK/5)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If you wish to create weapons for large (or small) creatures, the weight of the 
item will often get an unusually high bias, creating MASSIVE low level weapons 
with lots of damage potential.&nbsp; Instead, create the weapon for a human 
sized creature, and add the following modifiers.

<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Armor creation is, in many ways, much simpler than weapon creation.&nbsp; There 
are three types of armor: Cloth, Leather, and Metal.&nbsp; Strange armors could 
exist, but are variants of one of these three types.&nbsp; The armor values vary 
by location, and by material.&nbsp; Shields are considered to be HELD METAL 
armor.&nbsp; For a wooden shield, consider it as a HELD LEATHER armor for 
the&nbsp;purposes of&nbsp;further discussion&nbsp;(though your material would 
still be WOODEN). 
<P><U>Armor Points (Not the final 
Defensive value of the armor)</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Different types of armor have different level values, since the less armored 
classes would love to get that extra armor bonus at a lighter weight.&nbsp; To 
keep the classes balanced, the use the following guideline for determining the 
BASE POINT value of an armor piece.&nbsp; As you will see in the next section, 
different WEAR locations will have different ARMOR VALUEs for the same type of 
armor.&nbsp; A platemail breastplate is more protective than a platemail cuff.

<P>&nbsp;The armor weights are recommendations.&nbsp; If you 
wish to create a lighter version of chain mail that gives the same armor 
protection (like Elven Chainmail) go right ahead.&nbsp; It will not increase the 
level, it will increase the COST of the armor.</P>
<P><U>Armor Cost</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>The formula for the cost of the armor is: 
<P>COST = (A*A + V) * ( W/2) 
<P>where</P>
<P>W = Weight of Armor<BR>A&nbsp; = 
Armor Points<BR>V = material Value</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So our example of an iron Banded Shirt would cost 2173.5 (round up to 2174): 
(7*7+20)*(63/2). 
<P>
<P></P>
<P><U>Final Armor Adjustments</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
After you have computed the Armor Value, consult the materials tables for any 
bonuses that the material may give.&nbsp; This number is a bonus per Armor 
Point.&nbsp; If a breast plate of full plate is made from Adamantite (armor 
bonus of 4), it would gain 12 (4*3) points of protection, bringing it’s total 
value from 30 (10*3) to 42. (30 + 12).&nbsp; Material modifiers do NOT affect 
the level of the armor, even though it would have an effective Armor Point total 
of 14, it would still be available at level 23!&nbsp; Consult the Material 
Modifiers section below for an Armor Point reference.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Magic should be controlled by the type of MUD that is being run.&nbsp; If you 
run a low-fantasy MUD, you may wish to increase the Level requirement for items 
with magical properties.&nbsp; If you are on a high-fantasy MUD, you may wish to 
decrease the Level requirements for items with magical properties.&nbsp; Magic 
comes in at least seven forms:&nbsp; Magic Adjustment, <EM>PropFightSpellCast, PropHaveSpellCast, PropWearSpellCast, 
PropHaveAdjustor, PropWearAdjuster, PropHaveResistor, PropWearResistor</EM>. 
<P><U>Magic Adjustment</U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This field is available on any item, weapon or armor.&nbsp; If the item can be 
worn (but not used as a weapon), then every point of magic gives 1 point of 
Armor Value.&nbsp; If the item can be used as a weapon, then it gives +2 to 
Damage, and +10 to Attack per point of bonus.&nbsp; In either case, the magic 
adjustment improves the item’s saving throws against attacks that damage it’s 
condition.&nbsp; Having a Magic Adjustment greater than 0 makes the item magical 
(and detectable as such).&nbsp; Every 1 point of magic adjustment is worth 5 
additional levels to the base level of the item. 
<P><EM>PropFightSpellCast</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This property will make a weapon discharge a spell affect with each successful 
hit.&nbsp; As such, it is very powerful, and the weapon’s level should be 
increased by twice the spell’s typical level.&nbsp; As with all spell effects, 
use careful judgment when placing spells on items, and use your own discretion 
for determining the final level adjustment. 
<P><EM>PropHaveSpellCast</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
By simply having this item, the designated spell is cast on the owner.&nbsp; If 
this is a positive effect, add the Spell effect’s typical level to the level of 
the item (at least, depending on usefulness).&nbsp; If having a stone of 
Invisibility (level 7) is enough to make you invisible, then the stone should 
require at least a level 7 character (if it did nothing else).&nbsp; On 
something as powerful as invisibility, you may wish to increase the level even 
more. 
<P><EM>PropWearSpellCast</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This property makes any worn/wielded item grant the effects of a spell.&nbsp; As 
a general rule, the item’s level should be increased by half of the spell’s 
typical level.&nbsp; Again, use your own discretion when creating items that may 
be very powerful, such as stoneskin or invisibility. 
<P><EM>PropHaveAdjustor</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This property makes an item that is in a MOBs possession gain certain 
abilities.&nbsp; This is a very powerful effect, since a MOB could conceivably 
carry a lot of these items.&nbsp; The level increase for items of this type 
should be at least twice as high as those with the PropWearAdjustor affect. 
<P><EM>PropWearAdjustor</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>This property makes a worn/wielded item grant special 
benefits to it’s owner.</P>

There are many properties available in Coffeemud that enable unique item 
creation.&nbsp; There are inhibiting properties such as the <EM>PropWearZapper</EM> and <EM>PropHaveZapper</EM> that can be used to reduce the level of 
the item (I would say as a general rule, for every race restricted, reduce the 
level requirement by 2, and for every class restricted reduce the level by 
1.)&nbsp; Other spell affects may be negative, reducing the value of the 
item.&nbsp; Still others may be difficult to determine their effects, reducing 
the value of the item.&nbsp; Use your judgment, or request the system owner’s 
advice for particularly complicated works of magic. </P>
<P align=left><U>Cost of Magical and 
Miscelaneous Properties</U>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For determining the added monetary value of an item based on its magical 
properties, you must first determine how prevelant magic items will be in your 
world. Choose a cost Index between *10 for a magic rich world, to *100 for a 
magic poor world. Each level above the base level is multiplied by this Index 
and then added to the base cost to determine its final value.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Final Cost = Base Cost + (Total Level Increase)*(cost Index)</P>
<P></P>
<P align=left><U>Material 
Modifiers</U>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Material that you use to create an item affects it’s overall effectiveness 
without affecting it’s level.&nbsp; Make these modifications to the item AFTER 
completing the previous formulas.&nbsp; If you use a non-standard material, do 
not apply the actual material modifiers (other than value) to the item’s Attack, 
Damage, or Armor values.&nbsp; A metal club is superior to a wooden club, but 
using a better type of metal doesn’t increase the bluntness (or even relative 
hardness) of the club significantly.&nbsp; ROCK is an exception to this 
rule.</P>

Once an item is completed, add any values from materials to the end result to 
get the final values for the item.&nbsp; Note that CONDITION is a relative term 
that determines ARMOR and WEAPON damage condition.&nbsp; Different types of 
materials suffer differently from the various attack forms.&nbsp; A blank in 
this area means that it resists damage normally, and wears at the standard rate 
for all attacks against that type of material.&nbsp; A ‘+’ means that it holds 
up better against all forms of attacks.&nbsp; A ‘-‘ means that it suffers more 
damage from all forms of attacks.&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Mithril is a special type of METAL.&nbsp; Therefore, any item that can be made 
from a metal, can also be made from a mithril.&nbsp; Mithril has different 
resistance scores than metals, and has other special properties, so it is listed 
as its own classification.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If an item is created from a non-standard material, apply those modifiers 
FIRST.&nbsp; If they don’t allow for a MATERIAL MODIFIER, then skip this 
step.</P>

color=darkgreen size=5>Appendix D: Builder's 
FAQ</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How to Clans 
work?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
First, you need to&nbsp;use the clancreate command to create a new 
clan.&nbsp;You have to get at least MINCLANMEMBERS amount of new members before 
it will activate you (Set in the INI file). Activation means you will be visible 
in the listing, can buy land for the clan, can have clan bank accounts, and can 
hire mobs, as well as have politics with others.</P>
<P align=left>Once you've made your clan, people can 
'clanapply' to the clan. Of course, the person has to be at least level 
MINCLANLEVEL (Set in the INI file). 'clanapply' can be done even if you're the 
only one online. Clan bosses and leaders will see new applicants in their 
'clandetails' screen, at which point, they can 'clanaccept' or 'clanreject' the 
player (regardless of online status). Clan bosses can also 'clanassign' people 
roles, such as treasurer, leader, or even boss. Clan bosses and leaders may, at 
any time, 'clanexile' a member - as well as members can 'clanresign' </P>
<P align=left>Once you're accepted into a clan, you can use 
the clantalk channel to talk to your clan, as well as use the 'Clan 
Home'&nbsp;and 'Clan Donate' spells. The 'clanhome' location and the 
'clandonate' location can be set by bosses using the 'clanhomeset' and 
'clandonateset' commands. Bosses and treasurers may deal with any Clan bankers 
in your game. The great thing is, as long as there is at least one ClanMaster in 
the world, if MINCLANMEMBERS don't at least login in DAYSCLANDEATH days, then 
the clan will be purged automatically. </P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. What does Hunger/Thirst/Fatigue 
affect? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Neglecting to eat or drink can put a player into a state of hunger or thirst 
respectively.&nbsp; Failing to sleep for days on end can cause fatigue. Each of 
these will lower attack rating, armor rating,&nbsp;and damage 
capabilities.&nbsp; Hunger and Thirst will also decrease the rate at which hit 
points, movement, and mana are regained.&nbsp; Lastly, remaining Hungry or 
Thirsty for too long will result in death, though there will be plenty of 
warnings from the system before it happens.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How can I make mobs talk/answer 
questions? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Luckily, a great document has already been provided for the useful things which 
can be accomplished with the MudChat behavior. <A href="MudChat.html" >Here it is.</A> </P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do player Tattoos work? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG><FONT 
color=black> Tattoo's are intended to act as miscellaneous 
flags which players may obtain, like a quest point.&nbsp; These tattoo's can 
then be checked for as requirements to enter rooms or exits using 
Prop_ReqTattoo, or using Prop_ReqEntry.&nbsp; Prop_HaveZapper 
and&nbsp;Prop_WearZapper can also be used to check for tattoos.</FONT></P>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><FONT color=black>An example would be 
like this:&nbsp; The completion of a specific quest occurs when Gunther defeats 
the evil sorcerer Nunder and enters his inner chamber (where all the treasure is 
hidden).&nbsp; Entering this inner chamber automatically grants Gunther a Tatto 
called "NUNDERKILLER" because Prop_TattooAdder was on the room as a 
property.&nbsp; Now, elsewhere in the realm is the second quest where Nunder's 
apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and is up to no good.&nbsp; 
However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice is operating, the 
system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other Area) requires that 
Gunther already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo.&nbsp; If Gunther had not 
defeated Nunder, he would not be allowed into the realm of Nunder's 
apprentice.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4><BR>Q. How do I make poisonous drinks? 
</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> The 
best way to "mix a drink" is to make a GenPotion item, and add the relevant 
Poison_* as the potion spell effect. Another way is to make a GenWater item, add 
the Poison_ as an affect.</P>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I make other Archons? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Using your existing Archon, issue the command "create item ManualArchon".&nbsp; 
Then have your&nbsp;other player&nbsp;get the manual and read it.</P>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I make materials that the 
Common Skills can use? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Make 
sure you create a GenResource, GenLiquidResource, or GenFoodResource item.&nbsp; 
Only items of this sort will be recognized as raw materials by the common 
skills.</P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. Why don't my aggressive mobs attack me? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Aggressive mobs don't attack Archons.</P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. Why don't my mobile/patrolling mobs move? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Mobile mobs will not move if an Archon is the in the same room as them.</P>
