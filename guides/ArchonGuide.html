<P>Causing buildings and towers to appear along paved streets, mountains to rise
from the dust, and then breathing life into this worlds denizens may seem like a
daunting task, but you will quickly discover that it is not so.&nbsp; All it
takes is some careful planning, and educated execution.</P>
<P>Towards that end, but before we get started properly on the business of
molding a universe, we must needs take a moment to reflect on the powers of the
Archon, and how the universes underlying laws are navigated.&nbsp; Herein,
therefore, I have copied from the sacred scrolls the archaic and confusing runes
of "CoffeeMud Administration" for your consideration.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=red
 size=5><A name=admin>CoffeeMud Administration</A></FONT> </STRONG></P>
<P align=left>       The administration of
your CoffeeMud server is done from within the game server itself, when you are
logged in as your Archon player.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some functions can be performed from the
<A href="MUDGrinder.html">MUDGrinder</A>.</P>
<P align=left><EM>AHELP<BR></EM>This is the command that Archons will use to get help
on all of the commands in this section, on various administrative topics, and on
all of the various building "tools" discussed elsewhere in this document,
including such things as behaviors and properties.&nbsp; The atopics command can
give you a comprehensive list of all the topics you can get help on with
ahelp.</P>
<P align=left><EM>ANNOUNCE<BR></EM>If there is some message you wish to give to
everyone presently on your mud, this is the surest way to make sure they receive
it.</P>
<P align=left><EM>AFTER<BR></EM>This command lets the Archon
do things after an elapsed time, or even periodically.</P>
<P align=left><EM>AT<BR></EM>This command lets the Archon do
anything anywhere, regardless of where he is!</P>
<P align=left><EM>BAN<BR></EM>Deadly, but necessary, this command allows you to
specify player names, or partial player names, or IP addresses or IP ranges that
you wish to keep OUT of your mud.</P>
<P align=left><EM>BEACON<BR></EM>The beacon command is used to change the unique
home, start room, or recall room of either the Archon, or some targeted
player.&nbsp; Rarely used, it is typically invoked only as reward for&nbsp;a
player or perhaps a lesser admin.</P>
<P align=left><EM>BOOT<BR></EM>If a player becomes troublesome, or you just want
them to go away, you will use this power to knock them temporarily out of your
mud, regardless of where they are in your world.&nbsp; To make them STAY away,
you will have to investigate commands such as destroy or ban.</P>
<P align=left><EM>CLOAK<BR></EM>This command makes the player unlisted in 
commands like who, chanwho, and on web player lists.</P>
<P align=left><EM>COPY<BR></EM>Depending on the argument, this command can make 
copies of almost anything in your mud, from rooms to monsters and items.&nbsp; 
The thing you want to copy must exist somewhere in the world for you to properly 
copy it.&nbsp; You can even specify how many things you wish to copy, for those 
moments when one pot pie just won't do.</P>
<P align=left><EM>CREATE<BR></EM>Depending on the argument, this command can bring 
almost anything into existence, from rooms to doors, from monsters to 
items.&nbsp; The create command is discussed at length in the sections on 
building rooms and areas.</P>
<P align=left><EM>DESTROY<BR></EM>This powerful command can be used to banish objects 
and mobs, rooms and areas, or even players -- permanently.&nbsp;A&nbsp; player 
(user) need not be online to be destroyed. The destroy command, as it relates to 
rooms, exits, items, and mobs,&nbsp;is discussed&nbsp;further in the sections on 
building rooms and areas.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left><EM>DUMPFILE<BR></EM>When you want to view some text file on 
your&nbsp;computer through the MUD.</P>
<P align=left><EM>EXPORT<BR></EM>If you need a backup to your database, you can save 
your areas one at a time as files, for reimportation in the event of a 
disaster.&nbsp; This command will generate files with the extension 
.cmare.&nbsp; They are XML formatted text files containing all the data you told 
the system to export.&nbsp; In addition to rooms and areas, you can also 
specifically export players, some items or mobs from a room.&nbsp; The import 
command could then be used later to load the data you exported back in.</P>
<P align=left><EM>GENCHAR<BR></EM>This little tool accepts a character class name and a 
level, and it shows you the stats of an "average" player of that class and 
level.&nbsp; Although it's not a vital administration tool, CharGen can be a 
helpful aid in the construction of monsters, perhaps.</P>
<P align=left><EM>GOTO<BR></EM>Allows the Archon to zap him or herself directly to 
the room or mob of his or her choice.&nbsp; The argument is a valid Room ID, 
room name, mob name, or area name.&nbsp; You will find yourself using the goto 
command quite a bit.&nbsp; Walking everywhere sucks.</P>
<P><EM>I3<BR></EM>This module is used to manage InterMud 3 chatting 
channels.&nbsp; I3 is a component of CoffeeMud that provides for chatting 
channels which span across many many muds in cyperspace, allowing players and 
admins to talk to folks playing on other muds.</P>
<P align=left><EM>IMPORT<BR></EM>Import will suck in one or more data files and 
recreate rooms, areas, players, mobs, items, and lots of other stuff from the 
contents of those files.&nbsp;&nbsp;The data files that import will successfully 
read&nbsp;include (of course) the CoffeeMud .cmare files discussed under the 
export command.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, import&nbsp;will also take in area 
data&nbsp;files from other MUDs, such as ROM, CircleMUD, and others.&nbsp; Of 
the non-CoffeeMud area files, the ROM format is by far the best supported.</P>
<P align=left><EM>LINK<BR></EM>This command will cause two places to come together, 
making travel between them much easier.</P>
<P align=left><EM>LIST<BR></EM>The Archon is able to list lots of different things, 
for many different reasons.&nbsp; "list users" will show you all of the players, 
and when they logged on last.&nbsp; This is useful for weeding out olde players 
(see DESTROY below).&nbsp;&nbsp;"list threads" will show you how many Java 
threads are active.&nbsp; "list ticks" will show you all the objects making use 
of those threads! "list reports" will&nbsp;show you your resource usage.&nbsp; 
"list staff" will show you a list of your areas and any Area staff defined for 
them. You may also list things like locales, items, weapons, armor, mobs, and 
other things discussed further down in the sections on world building.</P>
<P align=left><EM>LOAD<BR></EM>This command will cause a text or file resource to be 
brought into memory.&nbsp; What happens to it from there is your business.</P>
<P align=left><EM>MERGE<BR></EM>This powerful tool is rarely used, but is vital if you 
need to make small changes to&nbsp;identical items or mobs scattered all around 
your world.&nbsp; It uses item or mob data gathered from the&nbsp;export command 
to merge with the&nbsp;items and mobs you specify in the real world, making the 
necessary world corrections&nbsp;&nbsp;that you want it to.</P>
<P align=left><EM>MODIFY<BR></EM>If something which exists is not quite right, this 
command can make it right.&nbsp; By telling the system exactly what you want to 
modify, you can change it into what it ought to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modify 
command is discussed&nbsp;further in the sections on building rooms and 
areas.</P>
<P align=left><EM>MULTIWATCH<BR></EM>A little tool which allows an Archon to gather 
evidence against multiplaying players.</P>
<P align=left><EM>ORDER<BR></EM>Although any player may order around their followers, 
an Archon can order ANYONE to do ANYTHING.</P>
<P align=left><EM>POOF<BR></EM>This command lets you modify the messages seen when 
you use GOTO to move from room to room.</P>
<P align=left><EM>POSSESS<BR></EM>Easily the most fun part of being an Archon is to 
possess one of the monsters and harass the players, making them think the 
monsters have truely come to life!&nbsp; Some enjoy this so much that they 
forget to return to their true bodies!</P>
<P align=left><EM>PURGE<BR></EM>A moderate form of the DESTROY command which allows 
you to clear out mobs or items without affecting whether or not they will 
repopulate (rejuv) later on.</P>
<P align=left><EM>RESET<BR></EM>Giving a parameter of "room" or "area", this command 
will make everything reset back to the state it was last saved at.</P>
<P align=left><EM>RESTRING<BR></EM>A moderate form of the MODIFY command which allows 
only editing a few fields on items.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SAVE<BR></EM>This command is used to update your CoffeeMud 
database. If you use "save user",&nbsp;the system will&nbsp;update the players 
data.&nbsp; "save room" can make aspects of&nbsp;a room permanent by saving it 
to the database.&nbsp; Saving rooms is discussed further below in the section on 
building.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SESSIONS<BR></EM>This command will list all of the players online, and 
perhaps a few who are on their way to being online.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SNOOP<BR></EM>This command can let you watch other players as they 
wander your world.&nbsp; This command gives you a second pair of eyes to look 
over the shoulder of the player of your choice.&nbsp; You will see everything 
they see, almost as if you were them yourself.</P>
<P align=left><EM>STAT<BR></EM>This command allows you to do everything from view the 
statistical happenings on your world, to the simple charicteristics of a target 
mob or player.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SYSMSGS<BR></EM>This important little trick is vital to those doing 
CoffeeMud development from the command line. It gives the Archon a unique vision 
of the world sometimes necessary for his work.&nbsp; For one, it makes 
everything visible to the Archon regardless of its state of visibility, 
darkness, fog, or any/all other conditions.&nbsp; It also reveals the unique 
identifying codes, classes, and names by which things are known or 
identified.&nbsp; All of this is very important when trying to modify or destroy 
things you no longer want in your world.</P>
<P align=left><EM>SHUTDOWN<BR></EM>Although CoffeeMud can also be brought down by killing 
the Java virtual machine, the proper way to shut down CoffeeMud is by entering 
the shutdown command.&nbsp; This will ensure that all users are saved back to 
disk, and that the system goes down in a polite and orderly manner.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left><EM>TAKE<BR></EM>Use this command if a player or monster has something 
that doesn't belong to them, and you need it back.</P>
<P align=left><EM>TICKTOCK<BR></EM>This simple little power will advance the world's time 
clock by one hour every time it is used.&nbsp; If it's day, and you want it to 
be night, or vis-versa, this is the way to go.</P>
<P align=left><EM>TRAILTO<BR></EM>A tool to tell the Archon the twistings and turns from 
where he is, to where he'd like to be.</P>
<P><EM>TRANSFER<BR></EM>Allows the Archon to zap&nbsp;someone directly to the 
room or mob of his or her choice.&nbsp; The argument is either ALL or the name 
of the target, and a valid Room ID, room name, mob name, or area name.&nbsp; Use 
this when you want someone to go somewhere NOW.</P>
<P align=left><EM>UNLINK<BR></EM>This command will&nbsp;separate two places from one 
together.</P>
<P align=left><EM>UNLOAD<BR></EM>If you've made any changes to your help files or other 
resources, and don't want to have to reboot the whole MUD, you can use this 
command as a short-cut.&nbsp; It unloads "resources" (try "list resources") that 
are in memory.&nbsp; By unloading resources from memory, you force CoffeeMud to 
reload your changes from disk.</P>
<P align=left><EM>WHERE<BR></EM>Allows the Archon to who all is online, and where they 
are on the map. An argument, such as "where orc",&nbsp;may be given to specify a 
specific mob name.&nbsp; That way, you can find out where you might have 
misplaced that wandering zombie.&nbsp; Where can also be used to locate rooms, 
items, or almost anything else.&nbsp; The mind boggles at the possibilities.</P>
<P align=left><EM>WIZEMOTE<BR></EM>The omnipresence of the Archon is reflected in this 
command, which causes a message to appear throughout the world.</P>
<P align=left><EM>WIZINFO<BR></EM>The channel of the most powerful, where their 
omniscience is derived by the appearance of periodic messages.</P>
<P align=left><EM>WIZINV<BR></EM>Sometimes an Archon wants a little privacy, and this 
command gives it to him or her.&nbsp; It will make the Archon completely 
undetectable, allowing free movement without harassment from players or 
monsters.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT color=red 
size=5><A name=security>Security</A></FONT></STRONG> </P>
<P align=left>CoffeeMud has&nbsp;an extremely flexible and 
powerful security system.&nbsp; It allows the Archons to designate who has which 
powers, and where they may exercise them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers can be doled out to 
minions as they deserve and warrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>By default, all players who have&nbsp;levels 
in the class of Archon are all powerful system administrators, who may perform 
all of the powers discussed in the last section and many many more.&nbsp; Of 
course, this does not NEED to be the definition of the all powerful, but since 
it is for starters, we will&nbsp;continue as if Archon and&nbsp;'All Powerful 
Super Duper System Administrator' are indeed and always the same.&nbsp; If you 
wish&nbsp;to change it, the SYSOPMASK setting in your&nbsp;coffeemud.ini file is 
the place to go, or to the &nbsp;<A href="MUDGrinder.html" >MUDGrinder</A> has a wonderful tool for security 
in the Control Panel.</P>
<P align=left>While players are just players, and are 
unable to wipe their own noses without an Archon to provide them a tissue, they 
may also be much more with the wave of an Archon's hand.&nbsp; The Security 
setting one sees when using the command MODIFY <EM>playername</EM> from the command line can be used to give 
players a small portion of the creative powers.&nbsp; By combining this with the 
Staff setting under Areas (see below), players can have their powers narrowed to 
certain spheres of influence.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>To upgrade the powers of a player, you must 
use the MODIFY command as mentioned previously.&nbsp; From the Security setting, 
players who are not SYSOPS may be granted very specific privileges. Each&nbsp;of 
the privileges may be limited to specific areas, or available 
globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;entry listed under Security for a player may be 
either a security Group, or&nbsp;a specific security code. Security Groups, like 
the SYSOPMASK mentioned above,&nbsp;are also defined in the coffeemud.ini file 
or from the <A href="MUDGrinder.html" >MUDGrinder</A> Control Panel. A 
Security&nbsp;Group consists of a group name, and a set of strings or codes 
representing privileges for&nbsp;that group. The Group names in the Control 
Panel start with the string "GROUP_", but only the part after that string is a 
valid group name.&nbsp; You should never include the "GROUP_" part when entering 
a group name into a players Security settings.&nbsp; Now, each individual 
security code&nbsp;which makes up&nbsp;each of the groups is implicitly global 
(meaning the power may be used anywhere), but can be&nbsp;qualified as 
area-only&nbsp;by prefixing the code with the word&nbsp;AREA and a space.&nbsp; 
For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" by itself&nbsp;confers the global 
ability to use the ANNOUNCE command. The security code&nbsp;"AREA ANNOUNCE" 
means that the ANNOUNCE command can only be used inside areas&nbsp;where the 
player is listed as Staff.&nbsp; See the section on Areas in this guide for more 
information on Staff.</P>
<P align=left>Use HELP SECURITY, or access the Control 
Panel from the <A href="MUDGrinder.html" >MUDGrinder</A> for a list of recognized security 
codes.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5><A name=planning>Building Your World: 
Planning is the First Step</A></FONT></P></STRONG>
<P>Before a single bird can flitter through the skies that 
you opened up, you must have planned the placement of that sky, and the song of 
that bird.&nbsp; I am assuming you have been given some general area to 
construct, some wicked kingdom, joyous elven city by the sea, or some other such 
nonsense.&nbsp; If not, get one; decide on the general theme of some area you 
wish to construct.</P>
<P>At this point I suggest you&nbsp;get a piece of graph 
paper or parchment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon it you shall draw small squares next 
to each other.&nbsp; Plot out every location you will create.&nbsp; The squares 
need not be equal in size, but they need to all fit together somehow.&nbsp; 
Before invoking the spells of creation, you should know where every door leads, 
where every path ends, and if X indeed marks the spot, where the X is.<BR><BR>Inside each square, you shall make 
small notes.&nbsp; What notes?&nbsp; Well, that's the next part of our 
story.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5><A name=rooms>Understanding 
Rooms</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>At the foundation of the CoffeeMud world is the 
room.&nbsp; Now, a room is not just some pink wallpapered play area, but simply 
a place.&nbsp; Certainly a kitchen can be a room, as can a pink wallpapered play 
area, but so can the bottom of a well, a stretch of rolling hills, the top of a 
tall mountain, or a dragon’s lair deep underground.&nbsp; Physical size does not 
matter with rooms; only your imagination can determine that.</P>
<P>Every room has a general foundational type that defines 
it.&nbsp; That type determines the behavior of that room day to day, whether it 
is outside or inside, made of wood or stone, a mountain or a plain, in darkness 
or light, a cliffside or deep in the ocean.&nbsp; The type determines whether 
one breathes water or air,&nbsp;chops wood or fishes, and how good the hunting 
is.&nbsp; This foundational type of every room has a name: Locale.&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you log into CoffeeMud right now, you can list the 
available Locales with the command "list locales".&nbsp; This list should 
include many different types of locales, most of which are 
self-explanatory.&nbsp; They include:</P>

<P><BR>For each room you are drawing on 
your graph parchment, you should note in the Locale type of the room from the 
above list, or from the list you received when you entered "list locales" into 
CoffeeMud.&nbsp; Keep in mind that some rooms are multi-rooms.&nbsp; These Grids 
and Mazes represent 2-Dimensional grids of rooms of a single sort.&nbsp; The 
dimensions are entirely up to you, and can range from a thin 1x20 trail, to a 
wide 15x15 block.&nbsp; The mazes expand on this by creating weaving paths 
through the grids.</P>
<P>The detailed properties of rooms are discussed further 
in the section on creating rooms.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5><A name=exits>Understanding 
Exits</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Now surely you did not expect everyone to conjure him or 
herself from place to place!&nbsp; Why, the pitiful halfling thieves would 
starve in their holes if this were so.&nbsp; No, each of the rooms you have 
drawn on your paper will be connected with things called Exits.</P>
<P>For any two rooms that one can travel between, there are 
always two exits.&nbsp; One exit leads from the first room to the second. 
Another exit leads from the second room to the first.&nbsp; Usually those exits 
are the same, but they need not be if you don't want them to be so.</P>
<P>All exits will take a person from one room to another, 
and may even take them back again if you choose.&nbsp; An exit can only be 
located in one of six directions: North, South, East, West, Up, and Down.&nbsp; 
The four compass directions are easy to fathom, but be careful with up and down, 
as they need not be unhindered flight, or a reckless fall.&nbsp; If, for 
instance, the destination room is a Locale like "InTheAir", then Up obviously 
represents the open sky.&nbsp; If it is another "StoneRoom", however, it 
probably represents a flight of stairs.&nbsp; The Down direction may represent 
falling off a cliff, but it may also represent a ladder down to the 
basement.&nbsp; Either way is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Exits, like rooms, can be of many different types.&nbsp; 
If you are still in CoffeeMud, enter the command "list exits".&nbsp; The list 
you receive describes the many connectors that can be mixed and matched between 
rooms.&nbsp; Some include doors, and some include doors with locks.&nbsp; There 
are walkways with pits, doors with needle traps, and many others.&nbsp; By far 
the most common of these Exits is called "Open".&nbsp; It describes a completely 
free and clear path between the two rooms you are creating.&nbsp; Here is the 
official list:</P>

<P>As you finish your graph parchment drawing, be sure to 
note those places where there are doors, locked doors, pit traps, and open 
walkways.&nbsp; If a door is one way, or if a door leads to one place when one 
enters, but does not go back to there when one leaves, make a note of that 
too.</P>
<P>However, it may come to pass that there is a rickety 
straw door to some hut you wish to have, but it was not listed among your 
choices.&nbsp; Fear not, for there is "GenExit" and "GenDoor".&nbsp; "GenExit" 
stands for "Generic Exit", and represents the finest in Archon power.&nbsp; A 
completely customizable exit flowing from one room to another.&nbsp; And thusly 
are exits divided from each other: the GenExits and GenDoors are customizable, 
flexible, changable, and otherwise maleable.&nbsp; All the other exits, however, 
are "Standard", meaning they are not very customizable at all, but they do load 
very quickly, and take up very little memory compared to a GenExit.&nbsp; 
GenExits, as well as the other features of exits, are discussed further in the 
section on creating exits.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5><A 
name=mobintro>Understanding That Which Creepeth Upon the 
Land</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The denizens of your land are surely the greatest 
accomplishment you will claim.&nbsp; From the lowly cooks in your kitchens to 
the great beasts in the darkest dungeons, it is they who will be remembered by 
those who visit your realm.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Funny then that for things so important, they should 
have such a short, ugly sounding name: MOB.&nbsp; If you are in CoffeeMud, you 
can list them: "list mobs".&nbsp; It will show you every creature that can 
populate your cities, dwell in your dungeons, or hide in your pantries.&nbsp; 
They are too numerous to list here.&nbsp;</P>
<P>If a creature is not listed there that you require, 
there is always the GenMob, that nasty formless being that can be shaped by the 
Archon to appear and behave exactly as it should.&nbsp; GenShopkeepers, GenPostman, and 
GenBankers&nbsp;are&nbsp;available to provide valuable services for your 
community.&nbsp; GenDeitys give your Clerics employment. GenRideable mobs 
provide transport.&nbsp; For more devious spirits, however, the GenUndead is 
also available, to strike fear in the hearts of the purest cleric.&nbsp; These 
mobs just mentioned&nbsp;form the troupe of "Generic" mobs, meaning they are 
customizable and changeable from inside the mud.&nbsp; The other mobs 
listed&nbsp;are classified as species "Standard" mob, meaning they are not 
nearly as customizable, though they do load quickly, and take up much less 
memory than the "Generic" mobs do.</P>
<P>GenMobs, as well as the features of MOBs, are discussed 
further in the section on creating MOBs.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5><A name=itemintro>The Things We 
Treasure</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Our last planning topic is that of the items that will 
be found in your land.&nbsp; Some of them will be priceless once-in-a-lifetime 
creations.&nbsp; Others will be reoccurring trapped chests that always seem to 
have enough gold for those bold enough to continuously risk their guardians.</P>
<P>The items can be discovered using the "list items" 
command.&nbsp; Other items include weapons, which can be discovered through 
"list weapons", armor from "list armor", and other miscellaneous enchanted items 
through "list magic".&nbsp; </P>
<P>For those items you need by are not present, there is 
also the "GenItem",&nbsp;"GenBoat", "GenChair", "GenTable", "GenBed", "GenLimb", 
"GenCoins", "GenCorpse", "GenKey", "GenLantern", "GenLightSource", "GenCigar", 
"GenPipe", "GenMap",&nbsp;&nbsp;"GenResource", "GenLiquidResource", 
"GenFoodResource", "GenRideable", "GenWallpaper", "GenJournal", "GenContainer", 
"GenFood", "GenDrink", "GenWater", and "GenReadable".&nbsp; For the fighting 
spirit there is the "GenWeapon", "GenStaff", and "GenArmor".&nbsp; Among 
the&nbsp;formless magical items are "GenPill", "GenPowder", "GenPotion", 
"GenScroll", "GenWand", and "GenSuperPill".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These items just 
mentioned&nbsp;form the&nbsp;gluttony of "Generic" items, meaning they are 
customizable and changeable from inside the mud.&nbsp; The other items 
listed&nbsp;are classified as "Standard" items, meaning they are not nearly as 
customizable, though they do load quickly, and take up much less memory than the 
"Generic" items do.&nbsp; These and the many properties of items are discussed 
below under the section on creating items.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=purple size=5><A name=creation>The Art of 
Creation</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Before beginning, you should log into CoffeeMud and take 
yourself to some place that is adjacent to the area you will be forming.&nbsp; 
You should also cast the spell of natural enlightenment using the following 
command: "sysmsgs".&nbsp; You should see an utterance that reads "Extended 
messages are now: ON".&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now your eyes will behold new wonders when you look 
around the rooms:&nbsp; You will see the Locale types of the room, the Room IDs 
that have been assigned uniquely to each room, the Area IDs of the area you are 
in.&nbsp; They should look like this:</P>
<P>Area&nbsp; :(MyArea)<BR>Locale: 
(StoneRoom)&nbsp; <BR>(MyArea#123) Joe Bob's Room</P>
<P>The first line lists the area name, the second line the 
locale type we talked about earlier, and the&nbsp;third line lists the Room ID, 
followed by the Room Name.&nbsp; Take note of them all, my friend, and learn to 
appreciate their beauty.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=roomcreate>Creating 
Rooms</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Now that you have your plan laid out, it is quite time 
to being execution.&nbsp; Gather your strength, and begin harnessing the power 
of the Archon, for you will need every ounce of it when the wood and rock chips 
start flying.</P>
<P>To create a new room most easily, you must first be 
standing in&nbsp;a room adjacent to it,&nbsp;one that will be connected to it 
through some exit.&nbsp; You will then utter the invocation of room creation, 
summoning the Locale in the direction that the new room should be.&nbsp; For 
instance, you wish to have a new room&nbsp;north of room "MyArea#123".&nbsp; If 
room&nbsp;"MyArea#123” is already created, and the new room&nbsp;is going to be 
of the "StoneRoom" Locale, you would bring yourself to room&nbsp;"MyArea#123" 
and utter the words:&nbsp; "create stoneroom north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createroom.gif" ></P>
<P>At this point, you should cover your ears, as the sound 
of a stone room falling to the north is often quite disturbing.&nbsp; Between 
the two rooms; the one you are standing in, and the one you have created, will 
be a default exit: the Open exit.&nbsp; Most times, that is ok, though changing 
it will be the subject of the next section.</P>
<P>However, once this is done, and the rooms are 
irrevocably linked, you can still throw a small twist on things.&nbsp; If you 
are still standing in room "MyArea#123" and wish to create a NEW StoneRoom in 
the SAME direction, it can be done.&nbsp; Uttering the words "create StoneRoom 
north" AGAIN and a new room is created.&nbsp; Now, what happened with 
"MyArea#124" you’re wondering?&nbsp; It is still there, and it still leads back 
to where you are standing -- a one way exit.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createroom2.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=modrooms>Modifying 
Rooms</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>For now, once you have created a new room, it is time to 
design the landscape of it.&nbsp; To do this, you should enter the room through 
the default Open exit that was created for you.&nbsp; You will find the room 
plain and boring.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To give the room a new name and description, utter the 
invocation: "modify room" and follow the promptings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <EM>display </EM>property is the&nbsp;short name that appears 
at the top of the room description, while the <EM>description </EM>field is the long text.&nbsp; Type 
whatever text you like into these fields, and feel the power as the place takes 
on a new form dictated by your creative magic.&nbsp; These two fields support 
the CoffeeMud color codes described in the Programmer's guide, as well as line 
breaks using either %0D or \n.&nbsp; Normally, that's all you need to 
know.&nbsp; However, these fields may also be customized to display different 
text depending on the weather, season, or the time of day.&nbsp; This last is 
done by starting the field with the string &lt;VARIES&gt;, and following it with 
text surrounded by the appropriate codes in the following format: 
&lt;CODE&gt;text&lt;/CODE&gt;.&nbsp; In all of these cases, the codes must be in 
uppercase.&nbsp; Valid codes include: SUMMER, SPRING, WINTER, FALL, DAY, NIGHT, 
DUSK, DAWN, RAIN, SLEET, SNOW, CLEAR, HEATWAVE, THUNDERSTORM, BLIZZARD, WINDY, 
DROUGHT, DUSTSTORM, COLD, HAIL, CLOUDY.</P>
<P>Rooms of the Grid and Maze sort present unique 
challenges to the molder of universes.&nbsp; In the first place, if you have 
SYSMSGS turned on, you will notice that the room ID displayed is a little 
different.&nbsp; In addition to the room ID of the parent room, there is an 
additional set of parenthesis showing where you are in the big grid room.&nbsp; 
It would look something like this:</P>
<P>Area :(Coffee Grounds) <BR>Locale:(Plains) <BR>(Coffee 
Grounds#19#(0,2)) The Demitasse Demesnes</P>
<P>In this case, we are in Coffee Grounds#19, child room at 
X=0, Y=2.&nbsp;</P>
<P>You will notice that you are unable to modify child rooms 
like this one.&nbsp; In the case of Grids and Mazes, you must be inside the 
Parent room to perform modifications.&nbsp; To get to the parent room, use the 
GOTO command.&nbsp; In the example above, we would enter "goto Coffee 
Grounds#19".&nbsp; This will allow us to properly modify the room, and add any 
creatures (mobs) to it later on.</P>
<P>Once you are in the parent room of a Grid or Maze, you 
may use "modify room" to modify the properties of the entire grid or maze.&nbsp; 
You can modify things like the dimensions in the X and Y, to make your grid 
anything from a long hallway to a giant hedge maze.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Modifying the <EM>display&nbsp; 
</EM>and <EM>description </EM>fields also has unique 
consequences inside a Maze or Grid.&nbsp; You may enter a random selection of 
text strings to display into each of these fields, so long as you remember to 
separate each individual text selection by the &lt;P&gt; string.&nbsp; For 
example:</P>
<P>Display: 'First Display Title&lt;P&gt;Second Display 
Title&lt;P&gt;Third Display Title'<BR>Description: 'First 
Description&lt;P&gt;Second Description&lt;P&gt;Third Description'</P>
<P>The above, when placed in a grid or maze locale, will 
cause CoffeeMud to select randomly among three different display 
title/description combinations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is an equal number of 
display and descriptions given (3), the display and titles will always be 
matched up in the grid children rooms.&nbsp; </P>
<P>After you have made your modifications to the grid 
parent room display and description, use the "reset room" command to have them 
take effect.</P>
<P>The "reset room" command will force CoffeeMud not only 
to reset a grid or maze, but to reload the creatures and items last saved in the 
CoffeeMud database.&nbsp; This can be useful if you make a few critters or 
things you don't want to keep and havn't yet saved.&nbsp; A corresponding "reset 
area" command does the same for the whole area.</P>
<P>And speaking of areas,&nbsp;rooms also may have 
behaviors and effects added to them, including a few more.&nbsp; In this case, 
the behaviors and effects above will only be active for this particular room. 
Aside from those listed under Areas above, here are additional Behaviors you 
might enjoy: </P>
<P>"DelayedTransporter" causes all those who enter to be 
whisked elsewhere.<BR>"Emoter" - yea -- this was mentioned 
under Areas, but it's just sooo cool.<BR>"Sounder" is still 
a good alternative to Emoter.<BR>"Mime"&nbsp;causes the 
room to mimic players.&nbsp; Wierd.. yea, I know.<BR>"MovingRoom" the fast train to somewhere.<BR>"ProtectedCitizens" will allow resident mobs to scream for 
help and receive it&nbsp;when attacked.<BR>"ResourceOverride" if you want fishing in the desert, or 
sand in your swap, this is the way to go.<BR>Lots of other 
properties and effects are also available for rooms.&nbsp; In addition to all 
the ones listed above under Areas, here are a few more you might want to add: 
</P>
<P>"Prop_ClosedDayNight" turns off the lights in a lit room 
at nighttime.<BR>"Prop_HereAdjuster" affect the occupants 
stats when in the room.<BR>"Prop_HereSpellCast" affect the 
occupants with spells when in the room.<BR>"Prop_ItemTransporter" drop it, and its gone -- 
elsewhere.<BR>"Prop_ItemReceiver" is the elsewhere.<BR>"Prop_LotsForSale" puts this room up for sale, and ensures 
that you never run out of new rooms to buy.<BR>"Prop_NarrowLedge" makes this a room you can cross.. if you 
are very very careful.<BR>"Prop_NoPurge" makes the room 
safe for dropped garbage.<BR>"Prop_ReqTattoo" checks out a 
mobs forearm before letting them in.<BR>"Prop_RestrictSpells" shuts down a list of spells that you 
provide.<BR>"Prop_ModExperience" modifies experience gained 
while in the room.<BR>"Prop_RoomDark" turns off the 
lights.<BR>"Prop_RoomForSale" puts this one little room on 
the market.<BR>"Prop_RoomsForSale" designates that this 
room, and all others like it nearby, are for sale as a group.<BR>"Prop_RoomView" makes this room seem to be another...<BR>"Prop_AbilityImmunity" protects the room from specified 
targeted spells.<BR>"Prop_RoomWatch" allows folks in other 
rooms to watch what goes on here.<BR>"Prop_SparringRoom" 
makes the consequences of death more palatable.<BR>"Prop_SpellAdder" puts everyone who enters under its 
spell.<BR>"Prop_TattooAdder" puts&nbsp;a little something 
on all who enter.<BR>"Prop_Transporter" send those who 
enter to the room you designate.<BR>"Prop_Trashcan" 
destroys stuff dropped on the ground.<BR>"Prop_WeakBridge" 
makes cross this room very very dangerous.<BR>"Spell_Silence" to quiet things down.<BR>And lots and lots of traps to put in your rooms: 
"Thief_Caltrops", "Thief_DeathTrap", "Thief_Listen", "Thief_MinorTrap", 
"Thief_Trap", "Trap_AcidPit", "Trap_Avalanche", "Trap_BearTrap", 
"Trap_Boulders", "Trap_CaveIn", "Trap_CrushingRoom", "Trap_Darkfall", 
"Trap_DeepPit", "Trap_Enter", "Trap_EnterBlade", "Trap_EnterGas", 
"Trap_EnterNeedle", "Trap_EnterSpell", "Trap_FloodRoom", "Trap_MonsterCage", 
"Trap_RatPit", "Trap_RoomPit", "Trap_SnakePit", "Trap_Snare", "Trap_SpikePit", 
"Trap_Tripline". </P>
<P>Ok! Back to work! </P>
<P>If you are ever wandering around, and wish to go 
directly to a room you have created, you may utter the magic matra "goto 
RoomID".&nbsp; For instance, entering "goto MyArea#123" would take you to the 
room we created above.&nbsp; This will especially come in handy when we begin to 
create and destroy the links between rooms, and there is no other way to get to 
a room. </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=linkrooms>Linking Two Rooms 
Together</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Now that&nbsp;you have created a room, and wish to link 
one of the rooms in your area with one of another, you can use a command that 
utilizes the Room IDs mentioned above.&nbsp; If you would like to create a 
northerly link from room "MyArea#123" to a room whose room ID is "MyArea#124", 
then you need only stand in room "MyArea#123" (use the "goto" command if you 
must), and utter the invocation:&nbsp; "link MyArea#124 north".&nbsp; This will 
create an Open exit between the room you are standing in, and the room whose ID 
is born out.&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/linkroom.gif" ></P>
<P>You should note that this command could be used as it 
was in the last section to create one-way exits to existing rooms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=unlinkrooms>Unlinking Two 
Rooms</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>If you wish to detach two rooms from each other, you 
need only learn the "unlink" command.&nbsp; If you are standing in the room to 
the south of the one you wish to unlink, and the room you wish to detach from is 
to the north, utter the command: "unlink north".&nbsp; It will do the trick!</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyroom.gif" ></P>
<P>Keep in mind that just because there is no longer a 
route from the room you are in to the other via a northerly path, it does not 
mean that there is no path from the detached room back to here again.&nbsp; You 
may have to conjure yourself into the&nbsp;other place and enter a "unlink 
south" command to completely detach them forever.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=xrooms>Destroying a 
Room</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Sometimes the pain born from a failed or evil place is 
too much to bear, and as an Archon, you can do something about it.&nbsp; This 
involves the destroy command.&nbsp; It does not merely unlink the room, but 
obliterates it altogether and forever.&nbsp; To do this, first make sure you are 
not standing in the room you wish to destroy.&nbsp; Such destructive magic would 
surely be your end as well.&nbsp; Then you must utilize the Room ID of the 
doomed place.&nbsp; If the room you wish to destroy has the Room ID of 
"MyArea#124", then enter:&nbsp; "destroy MyArea#124".&nbsp; It will obliterate 
that place from the planet forever.</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=exitcreate>Creating

<P>The difference between Exits and Rooms is a very 
important one.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Rooms describes <EM>WHETHER</EM> two rooms are connected, and by which 
direction.&nbsp; Creating and destroying Exits describes <EM>HOW</EM> one gets from one room to the next.&nbsp; Two 
rooms must be connected together before exits between them can be modified.</P>
<P>For instance, suppose you linked "MyArea#123" and 
"MyArea#124" as described above.&nbsp; By default, you get an StdOpenDoorway, 
also known as an "Open" exit.&nbsp; These exits can be walked through 
freely.&nbsp; Now suppose you wish to have a Door between the two rooms.&nbsp; 
If the exits between the two rooms are both the same, and you are standing in 
the southernmost room of the two, then changing them both is simply a matter of 
issuing the command "create Door north".</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/createexit.gif" ></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=xexits>Destroying 
Exits</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Just as unlinking rooms disconnects them, destroying 
exits can SEEM to disconnect them.&nbsp; When you issue a simple destroy 
command, and refer specifically to the exit, then you will not be destroying the 
link between the two rooms, but merely the exit that travels between them.&nbsp; 
Archons can still travel through these missing links, but players will not be 
able to.&nbsp; Also, destroying an exit only deletes the exit in one direction, 
not both.&nbsp; For instance, if you are standing in the southerly room of two 
linked rooms that both have Exits between them, and you issue the command 
"destroy exit north", you will destroy the Open exit between the rooms.&nbsp; As 
an Archon, you can still travel north through the destroyed exit, but players 
will not be able to.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit.gif" ></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, that an exit has been deleted, it is possible to 
create a DIFFERENT kind of exit for the northerly direction from MyArea#123 to 
MyArea#124.&nbsp; Issuing a create command like "create Door north" will create 
a door that leads from MyArea#123 to MyArea#124, WITHOUT AFFECTING the Open path 
from MyArea#124 to MyArea#123.&nbsp; This is only possible when the exits 
between two rooms are different, or one is deleted, as is our case here.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit3.gif" ></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now, suppose you wanted to have the same Door going 
between two rooms.&nbsp; For sure this is a more common scenario than the 
example we just went through.&nbsp; To do this, you must first delete BOTH of 
the exits between two rooms as described above. That means entering MyArea#123 
and entering "destroy exit north", and then entering MyArea#124 and entering 
"destroy exit south".&nbsp; </P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="images/destroyexit2.gif" ></P>
<P>Now, with both exits deleted (and thus the same), you 
can create a single door between them as we did in the first part of this 
section using the "create Door south" command.</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=areas>Creating and Modifying 
Areas</A></FONT> </STRONG></P>
<P>A town or village, country or demesnes can hardly come 
to be without the careful demarcation of their borders.&nbsp; What separates the 
town from the country, or one country from another?&nbsp; Like everything else, 
this is the decision of the Archon as he groups his rooms into Areas.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The best way to create your areas is to do so right from 
the start.&nbsp; The moment you create the first plot of land in your new area, 
or lay down the first building in your new town, you should designate it as 
such.&nbsp; Enter the new room in your new area and utter the mystic chant 
"modify room area New Area Name".&nbsp; Of course, where "New Area Name" can be 
anything you wish.&nbsp; Call it "Newarea Land" or "Goldfish Villiage" or "The 
Fruity Phantasm" or whatever strikes your fancy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now that you have designated your new room as belonging 
to a new area, it is important to remember to create all future rooms 
by&nbsp;doing so from&nbsp;rooms that already belong to the new area.&nbsp; Any 
future rooms that you build by standing in your new area room will bear its area 
mark, as well as any rooms created from any other room bearing the new area 
mark.&nbsp; If you fail then, you may be forced to invoke the power of the 
"modify room area..." command again to re-group the rooms you are creating.<BR><BR>Areas also contain important 
properties which may be modified.&nbsp; Enter the secret code "modify area" to 
go through a list of these modifiable properties.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The&nbsp;<EM>name</EM> and <EM>description</EM> of the area may be changed by following 
the promptings.&nbsp; You may also tinker with the <EM>climate</EM> of your area, which will affect the types of 
weather that will blow through it, and how mild or severe the winters and 
summers may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also where you may add <EM>Staff</EM>.&nbsp; A&nbsp;player whose name is listed as 
Staff&nbsp;has no additional powers unless their player Security settings grant 
them specific AREA privileges.&nbsp; In that case, the player would be able to 
use their area privileges in the area where they are listed as 
Staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;The section on Security above mentions all this stuff in more 
detail.&nbsp; Typically, a player is listed as Staff, and then given several 
area creation privileges in order to assist in area building and 
modifying.&nbsp; After&nbsp;all, sometimes&nbsp;creating a universe becomes a 
little bit too much work for one person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Strange settings like <EM>Technology Level</EM> and <EM>Archive 
File Name</EM> are available on the area promptings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry 
about these.&nbsp; The former is not very important at the moment, and the 
second is a bit too obscure for these lessons.&nbsp; The <EM>Currency</EM> field is discussed in detail in the next 
section on What Areas are Worth.</P>
<P>You will also be asked to add any <EM>behaviors </EM>and <EM>effects</EM> to 
the&nbsp;area that you wish to.&nbsp; These may seem strange at first, and 
usually you won't add any of these at all.&nbsp; After all, rarely does a plot 
of dirt exibit any behavior, and what the heck is an effect?&nbsp; Well! To the 
first, the wind blowing through the trees, the hoot of an owl, or a distant 
cackling noise are all considerable behaviors.&nbsp; In fact, it is a behavior 
called "Emoter".&nbsp; Enter "ahelp emoter" for more information about the 
Emoter behavior.&nbsp; There are other behaviors that Areas may benefit from 
too. Here are some examples: </P>
<P>"Arrest" will add law and order to your area, with 
resident mobs playing the cops and the judges.<BR>"Conquerable" has all the features of Arrest, plus it makes 
the area conquerable by clans!<BR>"Emoter" is what I 
mentioned above -- it's for inserting those cute little blurbs in the area.<BR>"FasterRoom" makes everything happen twice as fast here (or 
faster!)<BR>"InstantDeath" makes everything that comes here 
DIE!!!!!<BR>"LinkedWeather" makes the weather in this area 
mimic the weather from another area.<BR>"ProtectedCitizens" 
will allow resident mobs to scream for help and receive it&nbsp;when 
attacked.<BR>"PuddleMaker" will scatter some puddles around 
after rain or snow.<BR>"RandomMonsters" will populate the 
area with lots of hideously random creatures that you choose.<BR>"RandomTraps" will scatter some traps around your area.<BR>"ResetWhole" will cause the whole area to re-boot every so 
often, thus supplementing the natural "rejuv" process. <BR>"Scriptable" allows you to script the behavior of the room 
in a limited sense.<BR>"Sounder" is also for inserting 
little blurbs, plus it reacts to player actions.<BR>"WaterCurrents" will make those on the water bob and flow 
in the direction you specify. </P>
<P>As for effects, well, effects are special properties 
which you can attach to your new little holes in the ground.&nbsp; There are 
lots of nice properties that one may add to an&nbsp;Area, which will affect 
every room in it, such as: </P>
<P>"Prop_ReqNoMOB" to make your area a player-only place to 
be.&nbsp; <BR>"Prop_MagicFreedom" to fluster any spell-using 
folks that happen along.<BR>"Prop_NoChannel" for a place of 
quiet.<BR>"Prop_PeaceMaker" to go with it if you want peace 
AND quiet.&nbsp; <BR>"Prop_Hidden" will make the area 
unlisted to normal players.<BR>"Prop_NoTeleport" keeps those 
silly mages from teleporting in.<BR>"Prop_NoTeleportOut" 
keeps those silly mages IN. <BR>"Prop_EnlargeRoom" makes 
crossing the area eat up more Movement.<BR>"Prop_NoCharm" 
lets everyone remember who their REAL friends are.<BR>"Prop_NoRecall" keeps folks from taking the easy way out.<BR>"Prop_NoSummon" makes sure that everyone leaves of their own 
free will.<BR>"Prop_ReqAlignments" lets you limit the 
alignment of all who enter.<BR>"Prop_ReqCapacity" lets you 
limit the number of folks or items in the rooms.<BR>"Prop_ReqClasses" lets you limit the character class of 
those who enter.<BR>"Prop_ModExperience" modifies experience 
gained in this area.<BR>"Prop_ReqEntry" lets you limit entry 
to folks by many different criteria.<BR>"Prop_ReqHeight" 
keeps out tall people, or at least those unwilling to crawl.<BR>"Prop_ReqLevels" lets you limit entry by levels.<BR>"Prop_ReqRaces" lets you limit entry by race.<BR>"Prop_PKill" makes this a place that only the bloodthirsty 
may enter.<BR>"Prop_NoPKill" keeps out the riffraff.<BR>"Prop_Weather" to have the same weather in an Area all the

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff size=5>What Areas are Worth</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Currency is the system of&nbsp;money used by the 
inhabitants of the area.&nbsp;It is defined using the <EM>Currency</EM> field when creating and modifying Areas as 
discussed in the previous section.&nbsp; All of the bankers, money changers, tax 
collectors, postmen, and shopkeepers will deal in the&nbsp;currency that you 
define for the area.&nbsp; &nbsp;By default, all areas will use a system of 
currency that includes gold coins, and golden notes, whole notes, and Archon 
notes.&nbsp; You can change this system by defining your own, however.&nbsp; The 
way you do this is by entering a name for your currency, followed by an equal 
sign, and then a series of relative&nbsp;values and currency names, all 
separated by semicolons.&nbsp; Let's look at an example:</P>
<P><PRE>US=0.01 penny(s);0.1 dime(s);.25 quarter(s);1.0 dollar(s)
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>In the&nbsp;currency we have defined here, we have four 
different currencies: the penny, the dime, the quarter, and the dollar.&nbsp; 
Notice that each currency is separated by a semicolon in our definition 
string.&nbsp; Each entry includes two or possibly three parts.&nbsp; The first 
part is the base value, the second part is the name of the currency, and the 
optional third part is a "short name" used by shopkeepers when listing 
prices.</P>
<P>The first part of each currency entry tell us how much 
one unit of that currency is worth <STRONG><EM>relative to the base coffeemud unit of 
value</EM></STRONG>.&nbsp; This base unit of value is used throughout the 
system, and can be thought of as equal to one gold coin in the default 
currency.&nbsp; For this reason, it is wise for Archons to become familiar with 
the value of things in the default currency before defining their own.&nbsp; 
Under the system we gave in our example, a penny is worth 0.01 or 1/100th of a 
base coffeemud unit of value.&nbsp; The dollar is worth 1.0 or exactly one base 
unit value.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only rule when defining the worth of your currency 
units is that all currency values MUST be evenly divisible by the lowest valued 
unit.&nbsp; In this case, all of our values are evenly divisible by the penny, 
so we are safe.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second part of each currency entry is the 
name&nbsp;of the currency&nbsp;unit.&nbsp; This can be any name you 
choose.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that the name of the currency ends with (s) tells 
us that the system should include the trailing letter 's' when there are more 
than one of that currency unit listed.</P>
<P>It is completely optional, but if you wish, you may also 
include a short name for each currency unit entry.&nbsp; If an entry contains a 
short name, it will tell the shopkeeper to try and display its currency using 
just those units.&nbsp; If none of the unit entrys contain short names, then 
shopkeepers will tend to display their prices in multiples of the lowest valued 
unit, in this case, pennys.&nbsp; Here is an example of that same currency 
redefined with short names.:</P>
<P><PRE>US=0.01 penny(s) (p);0.1 dime(s) (d);.25 quarter(s) (q);1.0 dollar(s) ($)
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>In this new example, we have defined short forms for each 
currency, allowing shopkeepers to choose the most appropriate one.&nbsp; The 
prices will END with the letter p, d, s, or q depending upon which currency the 
shopkeeper chooses to display the currency in.</P>
<P>Once you have defined your currency in at least one area, 
you may use it throughout your mud by simply entering its name alone in the <EM>Currency </EM>field when you edit your area settings.&nbsp; 
In our example, US would be a sufficient value for the <EM>Currency</EM> field to tell the system to re-use our US 
currency in that area.&nbsp; You may also redefine the default coffeemud 
currency throughout the entire system by NOT entering a name for your 
currency.&nbsp; For example.:</P>
<P><PRE>=0.01 penny(s) (p);0.1 dime(s) (d);.25 quarter(s) (q);1.0 dollar(s) ($)
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>This last example, since it contains a blank currency 
name, would make our U.S. currency system the default one used throughout 
coffeemud, or wherever the <EM>Currency </EM>value in the 
area settings is also empty.</P>

    <TD>this represents the parameters passed on to the

      perfume is permanent, a expires parameter should always be used. A default 
      of 100 will be used if it is absent. 
      <P>The parameters are as follows: 
      <P><PRE>Parameters : Max/Min ticks, pct chance, expires, emote strings, ';' separated.
Example    : min=10 max=20 chance=25;smells great!;smells lovely.;smells like roses!
Example    : smell chance=25 expires=100;smells horrible!;is really stinky!
Example    : broadcast chance=25;smells awesome!;smells overpowering!
Description: \n\r\
All smell emote strings are separated by the semicolons shown above.  The first
parameter can be empty for defaults, or may contain a setting for minimum ticks
(min=10), maximum ticks (max=20), the percept chance of occurrence after the random
number of ticks has expired (chance=25), a total number of occurrences before
expiration (expires=0), or a tag to make the emote broadcast to adjacent rooms
(broadcast).  In the first example every 10-20 ticks, there is a 25% chance that the
object with this property will select one of the emotes randomly and perform it for
all those in the same room who can see it.  In the second example, a emote will be
performed 25% of the time, but will only emote 100 times before the behavior is
removed from the object.  In the last example, a emote will be performed 25% of the

<P>The above are all basis for the items created by the Clan 
Crafting skill.&nbsp; The GenClanItem and GenClanContainer are standard holdable 
items assignable to clans, usually for the purpose of use with the Conquerable 
behavior on Areas.&nbsp; They are only gettable the clan to whom they are 
assigned, and have properties to allow them to be captured by other clans as 
well.&nbsp; The GenClanCommonItem and GenClanCommonContainer cause their mob 
holders to perform tasks. The GenClanFlag holds a conquered area in place, and 
provides Conquerable behavior information. The GenClanPamphlet makes the holder 
a dissident and&nbsp;multiplies in rival clan areas, and the GenClanSpecialItem 
performs miscellaneous tasks when found in a conquered area.</P>
<P>Clan items all have a Clan Item type, which must usually 
be matched with the proper GenClan class type from the list above in order to 
work effectively.&nbsp; Here is a proper mapping:</P>

<P><STRONG><A name=geni22>The "GenWallpaper"</A></STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P>GenWallpaper is unique in that it is a non-gettable item 
which&nbsp;is never listed among the items in&nbsp;a room, but CAN be looked 
at.&nbsp; It is intended to&nbsp;provide targets for the LOOK command based upon 
objects which might be mentioned in a room description.&nbsp; Archons should 
make sure they have SYSMSGS turned on to edit wallpaper items, since they will 
not be&nbsp;noticed otherwise.&nbsp;</P>
<P>When GenWallpaper is created, you have only the name 
(which should contain key words for the LOOK command), the description that is 
seen, and whether or not it is also readable.</P>
<P><STRONG><A name=geni25>The "GenRecipe"</A></STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P>GenWallpaper is a complex but powerful tool for expanding 
the system of Common Skills in the CoffeeMud codebase.&nbsp; A GenRecipe is a 
piece of paper upon which is written a recipe, schematic, or some other 
instructions for enhancing the list of things which can be crafted by players 
using their crafting Common Skills.&nbsp; A player takes advantage of a recipe 
by mearly having the item in his or her inventory and using the appropriate 
skill for which the recipe was designed.</P>
<P>Designing a GenRecipe object is extremely complex.&nbsp; 
After setting the "normal" GenItem fields for this item, such as name, 
readabletext, weight, value, etc, there are still the two key GenRecipe fields 
left to fill in: Common Skill ID, and the Recipe Data line.&nbsp; The Common 
Skill ID identifies which of the common skills is served by the recipe.&nbsp; 
The Data line describes in detail the item which can be created by players with 
this recipe on hand.&nbsp; The format of the data line is a series of 
comma-delimited values which are defined for each common skill uniquely.&nbsp; 
There are two ways of determining the number and nature of each value for the 
data line.&nbsp; One is to open the appropriate common skill *.java file in the 
/com/planet_ink/Abilities/Common/ directory on your computer and observing the 
several lines near the top of the file which begin with "protected static final 
int RCP_".&nbsp; The number, order, and nature of the values will be identical 
to these variable definitions.&nbsp; The second way is to open the appropriate 
*.txt file for the common skill in the /resources/skills/ directory&nbsp;(such 
as weaponsmith.txt or pottery.txt) and noting the first line of 
the&nbsp;file.&nbsp; The first line in most cases will be a guide to the number 
and nature of the field values.&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><A name=geni23>The "GenInstrument" and "GenPiano"</A></STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P>The GenInstrument represents a musical instrument for the 
purposes of the several Minstrel spells.&nbsp; They differ only in that the 
GenPiano is also like a GenRideable mentioned above, in that it must be sat on

<P>Whenever a GenInstrument is created, much like the

<P>There are properties of items, armor, weapons, and 
containers that can be modified by the Archon.&nbsp; If one wishes to modify a 
dagger, one must either hold the dagger, or have the dagger present in the 
room.&nbsp; The Archon can then issue the command "modify dagger".&nbsp; If the 
item is a GenItem, GenContainer, GenFood, GenWater, GenDrink, GenWeapon, or any 
other "Gen" item, then the same properties as above will be presented.&nbsp;

<P>The Archons of your realm have lots of items that assist 
them in building and administering their mud.&nbsp; Lets take a look at 
these:</P>
<P><EM>The Archon Staff</EM>&nbsp; 
(CREATE ITEM ARCHONSTAFF) - the Archon Staff is the main tool of the true 
Archon.&nbsp; Also available from the OUTFIT command, it not only provides a 
deadly weapon, but a useful source of magical power.&nbsp; To use the powers of 
the staff, it must first be wielded.&nbsp; It is a two-handed item, so the 
Archon's held position must be given up for it as well.&nbsp; Once wielded, 
numerous magical words invoke the power: s<EM>ay 
targetname</EM> <EM>"refresh" </EM>will rejuvinate the 
targets mana, hit points, and movement; <EM>sayto targetname 
"level up" </EM>will give the target a free level of experience; <EM>sayto targetname "level all up" </EM>will level the target 
up to 91; <EM>sayto targetname "burn" </EM>will blast the 
target with hellish fire.</P>
<P><EM>The Wand of the Archons</EM> 
(CREATE ITEM WANDARCHON) - the Wand of the Archons is the one-handed alternative 
to the Archon Staff.&nbsp; It is also available only to true Archons.&nbsp; To 
use the powers of the wand, it must first be held. Once held, numerous magical 
words invoke the power: s<EM>ay targetname</EM> <EM>"refresh" </EM>will rejuvinate the targets mana, hit points, 
and movement; <EM>sayto targetname "level up" </EM>will give 
the target a free level of experience; <EM>sayto targetname 
"level all up" </EM>will level the target up to 91; <EM>sayto targetname "burn" </EM>will blast the target with 
hellish fire.</P>
<P><EM>The Goody Bag </EM>(CREATE ITEM 
GOODYBAG) - The Goody Bag is full of fabulous prizes which Archons may dispense 
to players.&nbsp; What's better, an item that is removed is always replaced, so 
that the bag never runs out.&nbsp; Inside the goody bad are piles of currency, 
pills to gain stats or experience, and others goodies.</P>
<P><EM>Ingredients&nbsp;Sack&nbsp;</EM>(CREATE ITEM INGREDIENTS) - 
The Ingredients bag has exactly one of every kind of natural resource the system 
offers.&nbsp; Removing one from the bag will automatically replace it, so the 
bag never ever runs out.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=mobcreate>Creating 
MOBs</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Greater even than the mages powerful spells of summoning 
is the Archons ability to conjure beasts into caverns and townspeople on to 
streets.&nbsp; To do this, the Archon need only issue the create command once 
again.&nbsp; Summoning a goblin into an ordinary room&nbsp;is as simple as 
entering "create Goblin".&nbsp; This will create a standard Goblin in the room 
you are standing in.&nbsp; To make him stay there, even after you reboot, you 
must save the room as described in the section below on saving rooms.</P>
<P>To find out what mobs are available for you to create, 
you can enter "list mobs".&nbsp; Entering "create &lt;mobname&gt;" will prove 
the true incantation for almost all of the creatures on this list.&nbsp; An 
exception, however, is the GenRideable.&nbsp; Since there is both an Item and 
a&nbsp;MOB version of that name, you will need to further qualify your create 
command by entering "create mob GenRideable" or "create item GenRideable".</P>
<P>If&nbsp;you wish to create your goblin a Grid-type 
locale, extra consideration is required.&nbsp; Locale types like MountainsGrid, 
WoodsGrid, WoodsMaze, PlainsGrid, DesertMaze, etc.. can all contain nasty 
monsters in them.&nbsp; However, two rules need to be followed for this magic to 
work properly.&nbsp; The first is that you can only save&nbsp;creatures which 
are in the parent Grid room itself.&nbsp; If you have SYSMSGS on, you can tell 
which room this is because it is the only one with a simple room ID 
("MyArea#123") in the description.&nbsp;Since no one ever actually walks into 
the parent Grid room, the only way to get to it&nbsp;is using the Archon GOTO 
command.&nbsp; The second of the two rules is that you must give the mob a 
Mobile behavior.&nbsp; The mobile behaviors&nbsp;are specially coded so 
that&nbsp;they will take the&nbsp;monster to a random room inside the grid the 
first time the thing tries to move.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG><a name=genm1>The "GenMob"&nbsp;and "GenUndead"</A></STRONG></P>
<P>Whenever a GenMob&nbsp;or GenUndead is created, much like 
the GenItem above, you are presented with a list of properties to fill in.&nbsp; 
Pressing enter will leave the property unchanged.&nbsp; The only difference 
between the GenMob and GenUndead is that the GenUndead can be&nbsp;TURNed by a 
Cleric, while a GenMob cannot.&nbsp;&nbsp;The properties include:</P>

<P><a name=genm2>The 
"GenShopKeeper"</A></P></STRONG>
<P>ShopKeepers are folks that buy and sell equipement that 
is given to them by Archons.&nbsp; ShopKeepers can sell anything from items to 
creatures, skills as a teacher, or spells for a price.&nbsp; </P>
<P>ShopKeepers designated as Land Sellers will sell any 
rooms in the same area as the shopkeeper which has the Prop_RoomForSale, 
Prop_RoomsForSale, or Prop_LotsForSale properties.&nbsp; Use "AHELP 
Prop_RoomForSale" for more information on this effect you may add to 
rooms.&nbsp; ShopKeepers designated as Clan Land Sellers will do the same, but 
only for Clan members.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, players and clans can buy and 
own their own rooms where their property will be safe during reboots, and pets 
can become permanent fixtures.&nbsp; This is also the way the Construction, 
Masonry, Locksmith, and other property-related skills can become useful.</P>
<P>ShopKeepers can also be Inn Keepers.&nbsp; To make this 
work, you need only give the shopkeeper a number of StdInnKey items equal to the 
number of rooms in your inn.&nbsp; For each room in your inn, make sure you have 
a locked door for each room, and that each of the locked doors in your inn has a 
key code equal to "INN1", "INN2", etc.. up to the number of locked doors for 
each room in the Inn.&nbsp; Players will then buy the keys to rooms, and the 
keys will automatically return to the shopkeepers stock after a single mud 
"day".&nbsp; The only other trick to making a successful inn is to make sure you 
do the "reset room" command to the room with the innkeeper in it, after the keys 
have all been given to him, and the room has been saved.</P>
<P>ShopKeepers are much more savvy about money and economy 
than most.&nbsp; They will often draw not only from the loose gold a player has, 
but any high-denomination Notes the player has in his or her inventory.&nbsp; 
The ShopKeeper will also give change in this manner.&nbsp; The player will often 
need to check the "change bag" newly arrived in their inventory to see the 
change that a ShopKeeper might have given them.&nbsp; These change bags will 
often contain the high-denomination notes mentioned before (such as a Golden 
Note, or a Half Note).&nbsp; Each of these notes are convertable into loose gold 
merely by GETting them from the change bag.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Whenever a GenShopKeeper is created, much like the GenMob 
above, you are presented with a list of properties to fill in.&nbsp; Pressing 
enter will leave the property unchanged.&nbsp; The properties include all of the 
fields listed above under GenMob, plus&nbsp;a few more:</P>

    <TD><EM>Type</EM></TD>
    <TD>a shopkeeper can sell Anything, General items, 
      Armor, Miscellanous magic items not included amongst armor or weapons, 
      Weapons, Pets, Leather items, Only buys the things he also sells (but 
      sells whatever you give him to sell), Trains players in spells, prayers, 
      skills, or songs, Casts prayers, spells, or songs on the buyer, Potions, 
      Land, and more!&nbsp; All shopkeepers can also buy what they sell, 
      excluding Trainers and Casters.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Inventory</EM></TD>
    <TD>
      <P>this is where you would "stock" your shopkeeper 
      with items that match their type.&nbsp; You may add to this list by 
      entering the class names of any standard items, standard mobs, or 
      abilities.&nbsp; You may also enter the name of any stray items or mobs 
      hanging out in the same room as the shopkeeper to put them up for 
      sale.&nbsp; This last is the best and only way to get Generic items and 
      mobs onboard.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>When an item is put up for sale, you may specify 
      the number of items like it the shopkeeper has in stock, and a price for 
      the item.&nbsp; You may also specify a price for the 
      item.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different values you can put in the price 
      field.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>* A given price of 0 or higher will ensure that the 
      item will have that price in local currency.&nbsp; For example.&nbsp; The 
      price is expressed in multiples of the the base value.&nbsp; A price value 
      of 20 will mean that the item costs 20 gold to buy, before adjusting for 
      charisma and other factors, assuming gold is valued at 1.0 of base.&nbsp; 
      If the local currency has only Latinum Bars valued at 0.5, then a price 
      value of 20 here would yield a 40 Latinum Bars price to consumers.<BR 
      >* A given price of -1 means that you are allowing 
      CoffeeMud to price the item for you.&nbsp; This should be the recommended 
      entry unless you know what you are doing.<BR>* A given 
      price between -2 and -100, or -1000&nbsp;is invalid!<BR 
      >* A given price between -101 and -999 will designate 
      some number of Quest Points to charge for the item.&nbsp; The number of 
      quest points is determined by taking the absolute value of your given 
      price and subtracting 100.&nbsp; So a given price of -135 would mean that 
      the item costs 35 quest points.<BR>* A given price of 
      -1001 or lower will designate some number of Experience Points to charge 
      for the item.&nbsp; The number of experience points is determined by 
      taking the absolute value of your given price and subtracting 1000.&nbsp; 
      So a given price of -1001 would mean that the item costs 1 experience 
      point, while a price of -9876 would mean that the item costs 8876 
      experience points.</P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Prejudice Factors</EM></TD>
    <TD>
      <P>This complicated field is where you can adjust the 
      prices the ShopKeeper sells from the programmed normal.&nbsp; An 
      unspecified value here will always return a value of 1.0 (which means NO 
      adjustment).&nbsp; However, you may enter one or more adjustments 
      separated by semicolons (;).&nbsp; Here is an example:</P>
      <P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2 
      >SELL=5.5 Elf Dwarf ; BUY=0.4 Elf Dwarf ; SELL=1.0 ; 
      BUY=1.0</FONT></P>
      <P>Each adjustment must begin with the words "SELL=" 
      or "BUY=" followed by a Real number designating the adjustment from 
      normal.&nbsp; A value above 1.0 will raise prices.&nbsp; A value below 1.0 
      (like 0.3 or 0.75) will lower prices.&nbsp; Values of 0.0 are NOT 
      allowed.&nbsp; If you need to all but not allow buying and selling, a 
      value of 0.000000001 should do.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>Each adjustment may also contain the name of one or 
      more Racial Categories (Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfing, etc..).&nbsp; If a 
      Racial Category is specified, then the adjustment will ONLY apply to that 
      race.&nbsp; The adjustments are read from left to right, so adjustments 
      without any racial categories should be listed LAST.&nbsp; In the above 
      example, Dwarves and Elves are given a very bad deal, where everyone else 
      gets a normal one.&nbsp; In addition to Racial Categories, you may also 
      list alignments (good, neutral, or evil), a sex (male, female, and 
      neuter), a character class, or the name of a faction range.&nbsp; Remember 
      that this field is evaluated from left to right, so any matches 
      made&nbsp;on the left that apply to a player will cancel evaluation of the 
      rest of the field!&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
      <P>Just as a bonus feature, if an adjustment begins 
      with the words "LIMIT=", then you may enter a number representing the 
      maximum number of rows of inventory the shopkeeper will display whenever a 
      LIST is done.&nbsp; This feature has no relation with the above 
      prejudice&nbsp;functionality -- its just bonus.</P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Budget</EM></TD>
    <TD>
      <P>This field is used to define the maximum amount of 
      local currency, per a defined time period, which shopkeepers will spend 
      when buying equipment from players. The format of the field is an amount 
      of money (in base values only) followed by the name of period (HOUR, DAY, 
      WEEK, MONTH, YEAR). All of these time periods are **MUD** time periods, 
      where one hour is about 10 minutes of real life time. For example, a value 
      of "200 DAY" means that the shopkeeper will not buy more than 200 gold per 
      day of any equipment from players, assuming that gold=1.0 in currency 
      value. </P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Devalue Rate</EM></TD>
    <TD>
      <P>This field is used to limit the number of EACH 
      PARTICULAR item that a shopkeeper will keep in his inventory. This 
      provides a ceiling therefore on the number of unique items of a kind which 
      a shopkeeper will purchase from players. The way this field works is by 
      defining how far the price drops, in percentage, every time the player 
      sells an item to a shopkeeper. Decimals (real numbers) are allowed in this 
      field. This field may also be used to differentiate between the rate of 
      devaluation of raw resources and other finished items. A single integer 
      field would represent the devaluation percentage of all items, while a 
      field with two integers seperated by a space would represent the 
      devaluation of finished items and raw resources respectively. For example, 
      a value of "20" would mean that the shopkeepers value price drops by 20% 
      every time this shopkeeper buys a particular item. If the shopkeeper buys 
      two, it would be 20%. Three would be 60% and so forth. This effectively 
      limits the shopkeeper to buying to more than 5 of any item (5 * 20) == 
      100%. A value of "20 0.5" would mean a devaluation rate of 20% for 
      finished items, and 0.5% (1/2%) for raw resources. </P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Inventory Reset 
    Rate</EM></TD>
    <TD>
      <P>This is the rate, in ticks (4 second periods) at 
      which the shopkeeper totally resets his inventory back to the last saved 
      "stock" items. Leave this field empty to use the INI default, or not to 
      have a reset rate depending. </P></TD></TR></TABLE></STRONG><BR></P><STRONG>

<P>A Banker is a special type of ShopKeeper that holds money 
and items in a special private account for players.&nbsp; Bankers can pay or 
charge interest on money left in the account, and charge interest on items left

it will only deal with Clan Treasurers.</P>

<P>Deities are the employers of Clerics, and the object of 
some players adoration and worship.&nbsp; Deities are necessary for the DEITIES 
command to work, and add great role playing opportunities for all players, 
though especially Clerics, since only with deities does their Convert skill have 
any meaning.&nbsp; Since deities of this sort being attacked and killed can have 
a negative effect on game-play, it is important that deities be placed in a room 
where they will be save from players.&nbsp; Give the room where your deities are 
Prop_NoSummon and&nbsp;Prop_NoTeleport to keep&nbsp;mages from zapping deities 
in or out of their safe room.&nbsp;</P>
<P>There are a few important points to understand about 
these supreme beings before continueing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deities may have separate 
requirements for who may worship them, and who may be their clerics.&nbsp; You 
will specify these below.&nbsp; Deities may also have a list of blessings they 
may bestow upon their clerics and their non-cleric worshippers.&nbsp; When their 
clerics perform a special clerical ritual, the deity will give the cleric ALL of 
his blessings.&nbsp; When a non-cleric worshipper performs the special 
worshipper ritual, the deity will give the worshipper one random blessing.&nbsp; 
Leaving these rituals blank prevents the deity from bestowing the proper 
blessings.&nbsp; You will specify all of these things below as well.&nbsp; 
Deities may also have a list of curses that they bestow as punishment for 
sin.&nbsp; When the clerics perform the cleric-specific sinful ritual, the deity 
will inflict all of his curses upon the cleric.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a non-cleric 
worshipper performs the worshipper-specific sinful ritual, the deity will 
inflict one random curse upon the worshipper.&nbsp; Whether these curses exist, 
how many there are, and whether there are any sinful rituals are all specified 
below.&nbsp; The last point is about special clerical powers.&nbsp; Deities may 
give&nbsp;one of their&nbsp;clerics a skill/spell/prayer/whatever as a special 
power after the cleric has performed the specified clerical power ritual.&nbsp; 
This power is taken away should the cleric ever rebuke the deity.&nbsp; Whether 
this power exists is specified below.</P>

MOBs</A></FONT></STRONG> </P>
<P>To destroy a MOB&nbsp;that is in the same room as you, 
you need only issue the destroy command.&nbsp;&nbsp;If an orc, for instance, no 
longer requires his existence: "destroy mob orc" will take that existence 
away.</P>
<P>Once destroyed, MOBs that have been set to rejuv will not 
do so.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;MOB was a permanently saved&nbsp;MOB in the room, you 
must re-save the room in order to make the MOBs destruction permanent.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=eqmobs>Equipping 
MOBs</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>You may give a MOB equipment to wear or carry as 
treasure, if this is done properly.&nbsp; First off, you can ONLY equip a 
Generic MOB.&nbsp; This includes the GenMob, GenDeity, GenRideable, GenUndead, 
GenBanker, and GenShopKeeper.&nbsp; No other creature may be saved with 
equipment.&nbsp; Generic or non-Generic Items may be used as equipment.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>To equip the MOB, first create the items you wish to give 
to your new creature using the procedure described above under "Creating 
Items".&nbsp; Now, you may use the give command to put the item into the mobs 
inventory, and the dress command to make the mob wear it.</P>
<P>MOBs can also be equipped with variable 
items.&nbsp;Variable items are&nbsp;items which may or may not appear in its 
inventory on any particular rejuvination of the mob.&nbsp; Variable items 
are&nbsp;created by modifying the Rejuv/Pct field on the item in the mobs 
inventory.&nbsp; If the value of this field is less than 1 or greater than 99, 
then the item will always appear in the inventory.&nbsp; If the value of the 
field is between 1 and 100, then it represents the percent chance that the item 
will remain in the inventory.&nbsp;&nbsp; A special case is created when more 
than one variable item is actually being worn in the same wear location on a 
mob.&nbsp; In this special case, CoffeeMud will ensure that exactly one of the 
variable items will remain.</P>
<P>Dealing with variable equipment can be very tricky when 
not using the MUDGrinder.&nbsp; It requires that the Archon remain in the room 
with the mob until the room is saved, in order to prevent the mob from ditching 
its equipment according to the variable rules.&nbsp; This is because the 
variable equipment rules will not activate so long as an Archon is in the 
room.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with variable equipment&nbsp;on MOBs also requires that 
the Archon remember to use the RESET ROOM command whenever returning to the room 
to make modifications.&nbsp; Only RESET ROOM will cause the mob to regain all of 
his equipment with their Rejuv/Pct fields intact.&nbsp; Forgetting to do a RESET 
ROOM before making modifications and saving the room can cause the Archon to 
lose variable equipment.&nbsp; Lastly, the Archon should take care not to make 
copies of variable equipment on mobs as room items.&nbsp; This is because the 
Rejuv/Pct field that is used to hold the percentage chance for the equipment 
while it is in a mobs inventory means something entirely different when the item 
is saved in a room.&nbsp; When an item is saved in a room, the Rejuv/Pct field 
refers to the rejuvination (repopulation) rate for the item when it is removed 
from a room.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=racecreate>Creating 
Races</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Although the myriad of available races should be quite 
sufficient for any Archon's needs, you may find yourself at a point where a new 
species is required for the balance of your ecosystem.&nbsp; In this situation, 
we must turn to the CREATE RACE command.&nbsp; Supposing we needed the raveging 
Woogler to grace our shores, we would enter:</P>
<P><STRONG>CREATE RACE 
Woogler</STRONG></P>
<P>And it would be done.&nbsp; Whenever creating or 
modifying a new race, the Archon is presented with a menu of selections and 
options available to customize the little boogers.&nbsp; Here is a description

<P><STRONG><FONT color=blue size=5><A name=factions>Factions</A></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Before learning the secrets of creating, modifying, and 
destroying factions, needs must we delve into the topic of what a Faction 
IS.&nbsp; A faction can be viewed very simply as a glorified tattoo, where 
instead of merely having or not having the tattoo, a mob or player can have the 
tattoo and have a numeric value assigned to that tattoo.&nbsp; Another way to 
view a faction is as a relationship between a mob or player and some idea, such 
as Goodness, Evilness, Orc Affinity, Reputation, or some other idea.&nbsp; For 
example, in CoffeeMud, a mob or players Alignment is implemented as a 
Faction.&nbsp; The Alignment can be thought of as having a tattoo called 
alignment along with a numeric value assigned to it.&nbsp; Alignment can also be 
thought of as the relationship between the mob or player, and evilness, 
goodness, or neutrality.</P>
<P>The faction system in CoffeeMud is a powerful engine for 
defining what factions exist, how the factions are assigned, how the value of 
factions rise or fall in value, how value changes are reflected in other 
factions, and what impact the value of a faction has on experience gain, ability 
usage, and ability skill gain.&nbsp; Since the values of factions are 
available&nbsp;for use in&nbsp;Properties such as Prop_WearZapper, 
Prop_ReqEntry, and all other features which respect Zapper Masks, factions can 
also potentially impact which items can be used, which rooms can be entered, the 
price of goods, the availability of Deities, and many other things as 
well.&nbsp; As an example, the alignment faction typically&nbsp;impacts all of 
the things mentioned above and more.</P>
<P>Now, as was said before, factions have numeric 
values.&nbsp; These values can be positive, like 2389473, negative, or even 
0.&nbsp; The range of values which are valid for a given faction are defined by 
the limits of the divisions or Ranges of a faction.&nbsp; A Range is a numeric 
division of a faction you have defined.&nbsp; A Range has a displayable name, a 
special code name for use in Zapper Masks, and of course a low and high 
value.&nbsp; A Range can also be tied back to CoffeeMud's built in "virtue 
meter", which allows you to define a Range as always granting the mob or player 
whose faction value falls into that range goodness, evilness, or 
neutrality.&nbsp; The lowest value of the lowest Range, and the highest value of 
the highest Range define the overall limits of the values of the faction 
itself.&nbsp; No player or mob may have a value for a faction which falls 
outside those highest and lowest values of the highest and lowest 
Ranges.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, ranges are the most important part of a 
faction.</P>
<P>Another important aspect are the range Change 
Triggers.&nbsp; One of the ways factions differ from simple tattoos is that 
CoffeeMud can manage the rise and fall in the values of the faction on a given 
mob or player automatically.&nbsp; The way these changes are triggered and 
managed is first through Change Triggers, which are applied when both the source 
and target of an action have standing or value in the faction, and when the 
source and target are different creatures.&nbsp; Each Change Trigger defines 1) 
What triggers the change (the Trigger), 2) Whether value is gained or lost in 
the faction when the trigger occurs (the Direction), 3) What percentage of the 
amount of change (after all other modifiers) is applied to the value (the Amount 
Factor),&nbsp; 4) several miscellanous flags to define the circumstances under 
which the trigger is applied (the Flags), and 5) a Zapper mask to determine what 
criteria the target of the Trigger must meet for this trigger to apply.&nbsp; 
The valid Triggers include: Murder, Time (a change occurs every 40 seconds or 
so), a type of skill being used, the domain of a spell being cast, a flag 
associated with a skill being used, or Add Outsider, which allows the faction to 
be added to those who do not have the faction, so long as they meet the other 
requirements.&nbsp; Valid Directions of change include: Up, Down, Opposite 
(opposite direction of the value of the creature killed and proportional in 
value to the distance between the faction value&nbsp;in the source and the 
target), Minimum (automatically gains minimum value), Maximum (automatically 
gains maximum value), Add (gains the faction if they don't have it -- useful 
with the Add Outsider trigger), Away (gain if monsters value for this faction is 
lower, lose if higher), and Towards (gain if monsters value for this faction is 
higher, lose if lower).&nbsp; Valid Flags include: OUTSIDER, which allows the 
trigger to apply even if the target of the trigger (not the source) does not 
have standing in this faction, SELFOK, which allows the trigger to apply even 
when the source or target are the same person, and JUST100, which overrides the 
normal modifications of a change (based on experience or other factors) and uses 
100 points as a base amount for the change from this trigger.</P>
<P>Now, lets discuss how to list existing factions:</P>
<P><STRONG>LIST FACTIONS</STRONG></P>
<P>The list that is shown with this command reflects the 
list of those factions which have been loaded into CoffeeMuds memory.&nbsp; 
Factions are loaded into memory when their identifiers/filenames are added to 
the FACTIONS entry in your "coffeemud.ini" file.&nbsp; Factions may also be 
loaded if a mob or player is loaded who has a faction which has already been 
defined.&nbsp; Creating new factions, as you can now guess, is a two part 
step.&nbsp; One step is to add its identifier/filename to the FACTIONS entry of 
your "coffeemud.ini" file, after the file has been created. To create the new 
faction identifier/filename, you must do the following:</P>
<P><STRONG>CREATE&nbsp;FACTION 
orc_affinity.ini</STRONG></P>
<P>This command will create a new file in&nbsp;your 
CoffeeMud/resources directory or folder for the new faction.&nbsp; This file 
will contain the default setting for your brand new faction, whose ID 
(identifier) will be ORC_AFFINITY.INI.&nbsp; You will now be automatically taken 
into the Faction Editor.&nbsp; If you had wanted simply to modify an existing 
faction, you might have entered:</P>
<P><STRONG>MODIFY FACTION 
resources/reputation.ini</STRONG></P>
<P>The modify command will take you into the editor for an 
existing faction, regardless of whether it appears on the LIST FACTIONS list, so 
long as the filename/identifier given refers to an existing faction file.&nbsp; 
The Faction editor contains numerous other&nbsp;complex and interesting fields 
to change, which we will now describe.</P>

    <TD>optional field showing which mobs or players will

      semicolon-delimited list, where each entry begins with the value to 
      assign, and is followed by a mask to determine who the value gets assigned 
      to.&nbsp; For example: "100 -race +elf ; 500 -race +dwarf" would mean that 
      all elf players and mobs receive this faction with a value of 100, and all 
      dwarf players and mobs receive this faction with a value of 500.&nbsp; If 
      this field is empty, noone is assigned a value automatically.&nbsp; If

    <TD>required field defining the values that mobs or

    <TD>normally 100%, this field is a fudge factor for

  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Affect on

    <TD>whether and/or how values in this faction affect 
      the amount of experience gained by players for killing 
      monsters.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the value is None, then this faction does not 
      affect experience gained by players for killing monsters.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
      the amount of faction gained or lost is a function of the base number of 
      experience points earned, and modified by the value of this field: Extreme 
      means the amount gained or lost is always towards one extreme end of this 
      factions Ranges, and always in a direction away from the value that the 
      monster had.&nbsp; Higher means the amount is always gained.&nbsp; Lower 
      means the amount is always lost.&nbsp; Followhigher means the amount is 
      always gained, and in proportion to how high the value of the monsters 
      faction is.&nbsp; Followlower means the amount is always lost, and in 
      proportion to how low the value of the monsters faction is.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Faction Change 
      Adjustments</EM></TD>
    <TD>like the Rate Modifier above, this field affects 
      the values of gains and losses in this faction.&nbsp; It allows you to 
      change the value of Gains or Losses based on whether the player or mob 
      with the faction matches the given Zapper Mask.&nbsp; Both the Gain and

  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Change Triggers</EM></TD>
    <TD>the events which cause the value of a faction on a

      information on the fields defined for each Change Trigger.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><EM>Ability Allowances</EM></TD>
    <TD>this defines the circumstances under which a

      unimpeded and with full privileges.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each entry contains a list 
      of flags to determine which skills, spells, chants, etc are being selected 
      along with the range into which a players value in this faction must fall 
      for the ability to be used unimpeded and with full privileges.&nbsp; 
      Requirements defined by Ability Allowances will typically determine 
      whether profficiency is every gained in a skill, and whether certain class

them both.&nbsp; You should make sure that the items, mobs, or both, are exactly 
the way you want them to be when the system is rebooted.&nbsp; Players in the 
room, including yourself and your followers, will be ignored by the command to 
save the mobs.</P>
<P>Currently, the resets using the Rejuv setting method are 
on a mob-by-mob and item-by-item basis, though the system does give you some 
default reset times when mobs are created (based on level). There is an 
alternative reset method however.&nbsp; If you were to make NONE of your mobs or 
items resettable under the current scheme (by making the REJUV value 0), then 
to&nbsp;add&nbsp;the Behavior called "ResetWhole"&nbsp;to each&nbsp;Area, you 
can simply reset every room in the area on a timed basis.&nbsp;The behavior 
will&nbsp;reset every room after noone has visited the area in a certain amount 
of time. This time can be set in the behaviors parameters.&nbsp; Use AHELP 
ResetWhole for more information on this behavior. </P>

<P align=left><U><STRONG>Weapon 
Groups</STRONG></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When building weapons, you must first select the group that the weapon falls 
under.&nbsp; The weapon group affects which classes can use the weapon, as well 
as what specializations enhance it’s use.&nbsp; Selecting more common weapon 
groups, such as EDGED or SWORD can enable a weapon designer to place higher 
level restrictions, if desired, on the weapon.&nbsp; This increase in levels is 
suggested to be 2 additional levels, but not necessary to keep the game 
balanced.&nbsp; Weapons within a group may deal any TYPE of damage, as discussed 
later, but have general tendencies towards one or two types.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weapons within a given category have certain general tendencies, as describe by 
the table below.&nbsp; Any or all of these can be overridden for the purpose of 
weapon design, these are just the basic type of weapons in that category.&nbsp; 
For example, flailed weapons tend to be unwieldy (have a negative to attack), 
but that doesn’t mean all flails are unwieldy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Similarly, the allowed materials are materials used 
historically to make that type of weapon.&nbsp; If a weapon designer deigns to 
make a weapon out of LAMPOIL, it is doable, just a little unorthodox.&nbsp; (You 
would probably want to make the weapon out of GLASS, as that is the outer 
delivery devise of a Molotov Cocktail.)&nbsp; Currently, weapon SIZE has no 
effect on game play, but that may change at a later date.&nbsp; The BASE 
MATERIAL of a weapon assumes that weapons are made from that general area, and 
use material bonuses based on that type.&nbsp; If you create a weapon out of a 
non-standard, ALLOWABLE MATERIAL, use the appropriate charts for determining 
attack and damage bonuses after the level has been set.</P>

<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weapon creation can be done by the designer fixing the DAMAGE that a weapon 
does, or by fixing the LEVEL required to use the weapon.&nbsp; To generate 
weapons that do a specific amount of damage which are balanced with the 
WEAPONSMITHING skills, use the following formula:</P>
<P>Level= ((2*D)/(H+1) + (A-W)/5 +R)*((R/W)+2)+1</P>
<P>where</P>
<P>D=base DAMAGE of the weapon before material modifiers,<BR>H=number of hands required to wield<BR>A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<BR>R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<BR>W=WEIGHT of 
weapon</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Round the final number down, to a minimum level of 1.&nbsp; Some general 
criteria to follow for weapons to avoid creating ultra-powerful, low-level 
weapons include:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Create the weapon for a HUMAN-sized character first.&nbsp; If you wish to scale 
it up or down for different races, use the WEAPONS FOR GIANTS table after 
setting the base level.&nbsp; A typical one-handed human weapon will weigh from 
1-8 pounds, and a two handed weapon will typically weigh from 10 to 20 
pounds.&nbsp; Using heavier/lighter weapons will create a strange, and possibly 
unbalanced, result.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Melee weapons should not have a reach greater than 1.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weight of weapons should include any incidental weight in using the item, such 
as carrying case, ammunition, and other equipment generally assumed to be in use 
with the item.&nbsp; For most RANGED weapons, this will add another 4 pounds to 
the typical weight of the weapon.&nbsp; For melee weapons, the weight is 
generally negligible.&nbsp; (Except, possibly for a Katana with a very ornate 
scabbard.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Round the final number down, to a minimum level of 1.</P>

<P>Notice:&nbsp; On the Executioner’s Axe, and the Katana, 
the size does not correspond to the size formula given above.&nbsp; That’s OK, 
since the size isn’t currently used, and since the weapon designer ultimately 
has free reign over weapon design.&nbsp; Also, if you compare many of these 
levels to that of the weaponsmithing skill, you will some discrepancies on the 
levels.&nbsp; Weapon construction isn’t an exact science, as long as you get it 
in the general range the game will remain balanced.</P>

If you wish to create a weapon based on the level of a MOB, you can use some 
algebra and convert the equation into a damage equation to give you the 
following formula: 
<P>D= ((L-1)/((R/W)+2) + (W-A)/5 -R)*(((H*2)+1)/2) 
<P>where 
<P>L=Level required to use weapon,<BR>H=number of hands required to wield<BR>A=base ATTACK bonus of the weapon<BR>R=REACH/RANGE of weapon<BR>W=WEIGHT of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Weapon Damage Type is entirely up to the weapon designer, but some guidelines 
have already been provided for the basic weapon types.&nbsp; Here is a brief 
description of the different damage types, and level modifiers for weapons with 
these damage types: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
NATURAL—All Natural weapons should be UnGettable.&nbsp; Natural weapons are 
available for a creature to use in combat, such as a Manticore’s tail spikes; 
but not actual weapons for adventurer’s to loot.&nbsp; Any GETTABLE Natural 
weapon should have a level MODIFIER of at LEAST it’s DAMAGE rating.&nbsp; 
Natural weapons would be favored by monks if they could get them. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
SLASHING—Slashing weapons are fairly common and include things like Axes and 
Swords.&nbsp; No special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal 
SLASHING damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
PIERCING—Piercing weapons are very common amongst the Polearm groups.&nbsp; No 
special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal PIERCING 
damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
BASHING—Bashing weapons are common amongst Blunt and Hammer weapon groups.&nbsp; 
No special care needs to be considered when making a weapon deal SLASHING 
damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
BURNING—This is the damage type for all fire based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Burning weapons tend to do more damage to cloth and leather armors, and overall 
are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there infrequent use 
amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base LEVEL if it is of type 
BURNING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
BURSTING— This is the damage type for all Magic based attacks and spells. 
Bursting are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there 
infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base LEVEL if 
it is of type BURSTING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
SHOOT—This is the damage type of projectile missiles, such as Bows and 
Guns.&nbsp; It is very similar in nature to PIERCING.&nbsp; No special care 
needs to be considered when making a weapon deal SHOOT damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
FROSTING—This is the damage type for all Cold based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Frosting weapons tend to be more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base 
LEVEL if it is of type FROSTING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
GASSING—This is the damage type for all Gas based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Gassing weapons tend to be more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base 
LEVEL if it is of type GASSING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
MELTING—This is the damage type for all Acid based attacks and spells.&nbsp; 
Melting weapons tend to do more damage to armors, and overall are more powerful 
than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to there infrequent use amongst 
weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base LEVEL if it is of type 
MELTING.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
STRIKING—This is the damage type for all Electricity based attacks and 
spells.&nbsp; Striking weapons tend to do more damage to cloth and leather 
armors, and overall are more powerful than Slashing/Piercing/Bashing due to 
there infrequent use amongst weapons.&nbsp; Add 2 levels to a weapon’s base 
LEVEL if it is of type STRIKING.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If you just want to guestimate a weapon’s level or damage, use the following 
formulas.&nbsp; They aren’t very accurate, and can create radically overbalanced 
weapons in the hands of players, but they are great for easy NON-GETTABLE MOB 
weapons. 
<P>LEVEL=DAMAGE + (ATTACK/5) 
<P>or</P>
<P>DAMAGE=LEVEL - (ATTACK/5)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If you wish to create weapons for large (or small) creatures, the weight of the 
item will often get an unusually high bias, creating MASSIVE low level weapons 
with lots of damage potential.&nbsp; Instead, create the weapon for a human 
sized creature, and add the following modifiers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Armor creation is, in many ways, much simpler than weapon creation.&nbsp; There 
are three types of armor: Cloth, Leather, and Metal.&nbsp; Strange armors could 
exist, but are variants of one of these three types.&nbsp; The armor values vary 
by location, and by material.&nbsp; Shields are considered to be HELD METAL 
armor.&nbsp; For a wooden shield, consider it as a HELD LEATHER armor for 
the&nbsp;purposes of&nbsp;further discussion&nbsp;(though your material would 
still be WOODEN).

<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Different types of armor have different level values, since the less armored 
classes would love to get that extra armor bonus at a lighter weight.&nbsp; To 
keep the classes balanced, the use the following guideline for determining the 
BASE POINT value of an armor piece.&nbsp; As you will see in the next section, 
different WEAR locations will have different ARMOR VALUEs for the same type of 
armor.&nbsp; A platemail breastplate is more protective than a platemail cuff.

<P>&nbsp;The armor weights are recommendations.&nbsp; If 
you wish to create a lighter version of chain mail that gives the same armor 
protection (like Elven Chainmail) go right ahead.&nbsp; It will not increase the 
level, it will increase the COST of the armor.</P>
<P><U><STRONG>Armor Cost</STRONG></U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>The formula for the cost of the armor is: 
<P>COST = (A*A + V) * ( W/2) 
<P>where</P>
<P>W = Weight of Armor<BR>A&nbsp; = 
Armor Points<BR>V = material Value</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So our example of an iron Banded Shirt would cost 2173.5 (round up to 2174): 
(7*7+20)*(63/2). 
<P>
<P></P>
<P><U><STRONG>Final Armor Adjustments</STRONG></U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
After you have computed the Armor Value, consult the materials tables for any 
bonuses that the material may give.&nbsp; This number is a bonus per Armor 
Point.&nbsp; If a breast plate of full plate is made from Adamantite (armor 
bonus of 4), it would gain 12 (4*3) points of protection, bringing it’s total 
value from 30 (10*3) to 42. (30 + 12).&nbsp; Material modifiers do NOT affect 
the level of the armor, even though it would have an effective Armor Point total 
of 14, it would still be available at level 23!&nbsp; Consult the Material 
Modifiers section below for an Armor Point reference. 
<P><U><STRONG>Magic Modifiers</STRONG></U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Magic should be controlled by the type of MUD that is being run.&nbsp; If you 
run a low-fantasy MUD, you may wish to increase the Level requirement for items 
with magical properties.&nbsp; If you are on a high-fantasy MUD, you may wish to 
decrease the Level requirements for items with magical properties.&nbsp; Magic 
comes in at least seven forms:&nbsp; Magic Adjustment, <EM>PropFightSpellCast, PropHaveSpellCast, PropWearSpellCast, 
PropHaveAdjustor, PropWearAdjuster, PropHaveResistor, PropWearResistor</EM>. 
<P><U><STRONG>Magic Adjustment</STRONG></U> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This field is available on any item, weapon or armor.&nbsp; If the item can be 
worn (but not used as a weapon), then every point of magic gives 1 point of 
Armor Value.&nbsp; If the item can be used as a weapon, then it gives +2 to 
Damage, and +10 to Attack per point of bonus.&nbsp; In either case, the magic 
adjustment improves the item’s saving throws against attacks that damage it’s 
condition.&nbsp; Having a Magic Adjustment greater than 0 makes the item magical 
(and detectable as such).&nbsp; Every 1 point of magic adjustment is worth 5 
additional levels to the base level of the item. 
<P><EM>PropFightSpellCast</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This property will make a weapon discharge a spell-effect with each successful 
hit.&nbsp; As such, it is very powerful, and the weapon’s level should be 
increased by twice the spell’s typical level.&nbsp; As with all spell effects, 
use careful judgment when placing spells on items, and use your own discretion 
for determining the final level adjustment. 
<P><EM>PropHaveSpellCast</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
By simply having this item, the designated spell is cast on the owner.&nbsp; If 
this is a positive effect, add the Spell effect’s typical level to the level of 
the item (at least, depending on usefulness).&nbsp; If having a stone of 
Invisibility (level 7) is enough to make you invisible, then the stone should 
require at least a level 7 character (if it did nothing else).&nbsp; On 
something as powerful as invisibility, you may wish to increase the level even 
more. 
<P><EM>PropWearSpellCast</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This property makes any worn/wielded item grant the effects of a spell.&nbsp; As 
a general rule, the item’s level should be increased by half of the spell’s 
typical level.&nbsp; Again, use your own discretion when creating items that may 
be very powerful, such as stoneskin or invisibility. 
<P><EM>PropHaveAdjustor</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This property makes an item that is in a MOBs possession gain certain 
abilities.&nbsp; This is a very powerful effect, since a MOB could conceivably 
carry a lot of these items.&nbsp; The level increase for items of this type 
should be at least twice as high as those with the PropWearAdjustor effect. 
<P><EM>PropWearAdjustor</EM> 
<P>
<P></P>
<P>This property makes a worn/wielded item grant special 
benefits to it’s owner.</P>

the item (I would say as a general rule, for every race restricted, reduce the 
level requirement by 2, and for every class restricted reduce the level by 
1.)&nbsp; Other spell effects may be negative, reducing the value of the 
item.&nbsp; Still others may be difficult to determine their effects, reducing 
the value of the item.&nbsp; Use your judgment, or request the system owner’s 
advice for particularly complicated works of magic. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For determining the added monetary value of an item based on its magical 
properties, you must first determine how prevelant magic items will be in your 
world. Choose a cost Index between *10 for a magic rich world, to *100 for a 
magic poor world. Each level above the base level is multiplied by this Index 
and then added to the base cost to determine its final value.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Final Cost = Base Cost + (Total Level Increase)*(cost Index)</P>
<P></P>
<P align=left><U><STRONG>Material Modifiers</STRONG></U>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Material that you use to create an item affects it’s overall effectiveness 
without affecting it’s level.&nbsp; Make these modifications to the item AFTER 
completing the previous formulas.&nbsp; If you use a non-standard material, do 
not apply the actual material modifiers (other than value) to the item’s Attack, 
Damage, or Armor values.&nbsp; A metal club is superior to a wooden club, but 
using a better type of metal doesn’t increase the bluntness (or even relative 
hardness) of the club significantly.&nbsp; ROCK is an exception to this 
rule.</P>

Once an item is completed, add any values from materials to the end result to 
get the final values for the item.&nbsp; Note that CONDITION is a relative term 
that determines ARMOR and WEAPON damage condition.&nbsp; Different types of 
materials suffer differently from the various attack forms.&nbsp; A blank in 
this area means that it resists damage normally, and wears at the standard rate 
for all attacks against that type of material.&nbsp; A ‘+’ means that it holds 
up better against all forms of attacks.&nbsp; A ‘-‘ means that it suffers more 
damage from all forms of attacks.&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Mithril is a special type of METAL.&nbsp; Therefore, any item that can be made 
from a metal, can also be made from a mithril.&nbsp; Mithril has different 
resistance scores than metals, and has other special properties, so it is listed 
as its own classification.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If an item is created from a non-standard material, apply those modifiers 
FIRST.&nbsp; If they don’t allow for a MATERIAL MODIFIER, then skip this 
step.</P>

<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How to Clans 
work?</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
First, you need to&nbsp;use the clancreate command to create a new 
clan.&nbsp;You have to get at least MINCLANMEMBERS amount of new members before 
it will activate you (Set in the INI file). Activation means you will be visible 
in the listing, can buy land for the clan, can have clan bank accounts, and can 
hire mobs, as well as have politics with others.</P>
<P align=left>Once you've made your clan, people can 
'clanapply' to the clan. Of course, the person has to be at least level 
MINCLANLEVEL (Set in the INI file). 'clanapply' can be done even if you're the 
only one online. Clan bosses can set qualifications to the clan with the 
'clanqual' command and both bosses and leaders will see new applicants in their 
'clandetails' screen, at which point, they can 'clanaccept' or 'clanreject' the 
player (regardless of online status). Clan bosses can also 'clanassign' people 
roles, such as treasurer, leader, or even boss. Clan bosses and leaders may, at 
any time, 'clanexile' a member - as well as members can 'clanresign' </P>
<P align=left>Once you're accepted into a clan, you can use 
the clantalk channel to talk to your clan, as well as use the 'Clan 
Home'&nbsp;and 'Clan Donate' spells. The 'clanhome' location and the 
'clandonate' location can be set by bosses using the 'clanhomeset' and 
'clandonateset' commands. Clan morgues can be designated with the 
'clanmorgueset' command. Bosses and treasurers may deal with any Clan bankers 
and Clan Postmen in your game. If MINCLANMEMBERS don't at least login in 
DAYSCLANDEATH days, then the clan will be purged automatically. </P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. What does Hunger/Thirst/Fatigue 
affect? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Neglecting to eat or drink can put a player into a state of hunger or thirst 
respectively.&nbsp; Failing to sleep for days on end can cause fatigue. Each of 
these will lower attack rating, armor rating,&nbsp;and damage 
capabilities.&nbsp; Hunger and Thirst will also decrease the rate at which hit 
points, movement, and mana are regained.&nbsp; Lastly, remaining Hungry or 
Thirsty for too long will result in death, though there will be plenty of 
warnings from the system before it happens.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How can I make mobs talk/answer 
questions? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Luckily, a great document has already been provided for the useful things which 
can be accomplished with the MudChat behavior. <A href="MudChat.html" >Here it is.</A> </P>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do player Tattoos work? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG><FONT 
color=black> Tattoo's are intended to act as miscellaneous 
flags which players may obtain, like a quest point.&nbsp; These tattoo's can 
then be checked for as requirements to enter rooms or exits using 
Prop_ReqTattoo, or using Prop_ReqEntry.&nbsp; Prop_HaveZapper 
and&nbsp;Prop_WearZapper can also be used to check for tattoos.</FONT></P>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><FONT color=black>An example would be 
like this:&nbsp; The completion of a specific quest occurs when Gunther defeats 
the evil sorcerer Nunder and enters his inner chamber (where all the treasure is 
hidden).&nbsp; Entering this inner chamber automatically grants Gunther a Tatto 
called "NUNDERKILLER" because Prop_TattooAdder was on the room as a 
property.&nbsp; Now, elsewhere in the realm is the second quest where Nunder's 
apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and is up to no good.&nbsp; 
However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice is operating, the 
system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other Area) requires that 
Gunther already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo.&nbsp; If Gunther had not 
defeated Nunder, he would not be allowed into the realm of Nunder's 
apprentice.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4><BR>Q. How do I make poisonous drinks? 
</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> The 
best way to "mix a drink" is to make a GenPotion item, and add the relevant 
Poison_* as the potion spell effect. Another way is to make a GenDrink item, add 
the Poison_ as an effect.</P>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I make other Archons? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Using your existing Archon, issue the command "create item ManualArchon".&nbsp; 
Then have your&nbsp;other player&nbsp;get the manual and read it.</P>
<DIV><SPAN class=453251818-08032003>
<P align=left><STRONG><FONT 
color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I make materials that the 
Common Skills can use? </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Make 
sure you create a GenResource, GenLiquidResource, or GenFoodResource item.&nbsp; 
Only items of this sort will be recognized as raw materials by the common 
skills.</P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. Why don't my aggressive mobs attack me? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Aggressive mobs don't attack Archons, or anyone else with CMDROOMS or ORDER 
security privileges.</P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. Why don't my mobile/patrolling mobs move? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG> 
Mobile mobs will not move if an Archon, or anyone else with CMDROOMS or ORDER 
security privileges&nbsp;is the in the same room as them.</P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I import CoffeeMud areas

<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. Why isn't my variable equipment working? 
</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp;Equipment which is placed on a mob and 
designated as variable will not disapear so long&nbsp;as an Archon, or anyone 
else with CMDROOMS or ORDER security privileges&nbsp;is the in the same room as 
them.</P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I make a Classless version of 
CoffeeMud</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp; The coffeemud.ini file has a parameter 
called DISABLE.&nbsp; If CLASSES is added to the disable parameter, then 
CoffeeMud will skip the class selection process at logon, and automatically set 
the player to the normally dormant class called "PlayerClass".&nbsp; This class, 
by default, qualifies for all skills.&nbsp; If you'd like to have the 
PlayerClass qualify for only a certain subset of skills, you will need to either 
modify PlayerClass.java, or create a new GenCharClass called "PlayerClass" and 
give it your own set of skills to qualify for.&nbsp; If you want, you can create 
certain races for which there is no character class by setting the CLASSLESS 
flag within your GenRace or custom coded Race.&nbsp; This will also skip the 
class selection process for new players, and automatically select a class which 
(despite the DISABLE flag) the race qualifies for.&nbsp; See StdRace.java for 
how to code the classless() flag in races.&nbsp; See the section on 
GenCharClasses above for information on racial class qualifying.</P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I make a&nbsp;Levelless version of 
CoffeeMud</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp; The coffeemud.ini file has a parameter 
called DISABLE.&nbsp; If LEVELS is added to the disable parameter, then 
CoffeeMud will not allow any player to gain or lose levels, either magically or 
through normal means, despite any experience points that may be gained or 
lost.&nbsp; Individual classes and races can also be designated as being 
"levelless" through either coding custom classes and races, or through the 
GenRace/GenCharClass creation process. See StdRace.java or 
StdCharClass.java&nbsp;for how to code the classless() flag in java.&nbsp; See 
the section on GenCharClasses or GenRaces&nbsp;above for information on how to 
do it through that interface.&nbsp; Note that adding LEVELS to the DISABLE flag 
does not prevent gaining or losing experience, but just the leveling 
consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P align=left><SPAN class=453251818-08032003><STRONG><FONT color=#9400d3 size=4>Q. How do I make a&nbsp;Levelless AND Experience

<P align=left><STRONG>A.</STRONG>&nbsp; The coffeemud.ini file has a parameter

Quests</A></FONT></STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Quests are tasks which can be completed by players for 
prizes, typically quest points, experience, money, or all three.&nbsp; Quest 
tasks, the monitoring of their completion and status, as well as their 
availability, can all be automated by CoffeeMud. </P>
<P>A quest is created by an Archon using the <STRONG>CREATE QUEST</STRONG> [SCRIPT] command from the command 
line. Where [SCRIPT] is a either a complete quest script, where each command 
line is terminated by a semicolon (;), or a load command of the form 
LOAD=[SCRIPT PATH]. An example of a create script using a load command is as 
follows:</P>
<P><STRONG>CREATE QUEST</STRONG> 
LOAD=c:/temp/myquest.txt</P>
<P>To load one of the built-in quests, for instance, 
use:</P>
<P><STRONG>CREATE QUEST</STRONG> 
LOAD=quests/robbed/robbed.quest</P>
<P>Quests may be&nbsp;started automatically (autoquests) 
from inside the quest script by including&nbsp;the SET WAIT and SET INTERVAL 
commands, or they&nbsp;may be started manually by using the <STRONG>MODIFY QUEST</STRONG> [QUEST NAME] command. </P>
<P>Quests can be listed, to see their status, using the 
<STRONG>LIST QUESTS</STRONG> command. </P>
<P>Quests can be removed from the list using the <STRONG>DESTROY QUEST</STRONG> [QUEST NAME] command.</P>
<P>Quests can be saved using the <STRONG>SAVE QUESTS</STRONG> command. Quests saved this way will be 
restored during the next CoffeeMud reboot. </P>
<P><FONT color=#4169e1 size=4><STRONG>Quest Scripts</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>When creating a new quest using the <STRONG>CREATE QUEST</STRONG> [SCRIPT] command, whether you use the 
load command to specify an external script, or include the script directly into 
the create command, the quest script commands are as follows:</P>
<P>SET NAME [QUEST NAME] - the *unique* name of your quest. 
This is a required command! </P>
<P>SET DURATION [#TICKS] - # of ticks (4 second periods) 
the quest will last once started. This is a required command! </P>
<P>SET WAIT [#TICKS] - minimum # ticks to wait between 
auto-starts of the quest. Required for auto-quests only! </P>
<P>SET INTERVAL [#TICKS] - random # ticks (1-#TICKS) to 
wait between auto-starting the quest, AFTER the WAIT period (see above) is over. 
Required for auto-quests! </P>
<P>IMPORT MOBS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of 
custom mobs from a .CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM MOBS command. The 
parameter must be the path and file name of the file. </P>
<P>IMPORT ITEMS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list 
of custom items from a .CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM ITEMS 
command. The parameter must be the path and file name of the file. </P>
<P>SET AREA ([AREA NAME]) - will set the current designated 
area to the area specified. Although this does nothing in itself, it is 
important for the several commands which load mobs and items. The area name ANY 
may be given to choose a random area. If no area name is given, this will CLEAR 
the area designation. This can have a profound impact on how subsequent mob or 
item loading, or room setting commands work. </P>
<P>SET ROOM ([ROOM NAME]) - will set the current designated 
room to the one specified. If a room or area has been previously designated, and 
not cleared (see SET AREA), then the room will be selected from the designated 
area according to the room name criteria. Otherwise, a room from the whole map 
will be chosen. If a room name of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen 
randomly from the world, or the area if designated. If no room name is given, 
this will effectly clear the room designation (but it will not clear the area 
designation!). </P>
<P>SET LOCALE ([LOCALE]) - will set the current designated 
room to the one with the specified class name. If a room or area has been 
previously designated, and not cleared (see SET AREA), then the room will be 
selected from the designated area according to the locale criteria. Otherwise, a 
room from the whole map will be chosen. If a locale of ANY is given, then the 
room will be chosen randomly from the world, or the area if designated. If no 
locale is given, this will effectly clear the room designation (but it will not 
clear the area designation!). </P>
<P>SET MOBGROUP ([MOB NAME]) - will designate a set of mobs 
with the given name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask similar in 
functionality to the one described in the Prop_HaveZapper will apply in addition 
to the name mask entered. The mobs chosen will be selected from those in the 
designated area (if one was designated) or the world. The mobs must exist 
somewhere in the map for this command to work. </P>
<P>SET MOB ([MOB NAME]) - will set the current mob to one 
with the given name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask similar in 
functionality to the one described in the Prop_HaveZapper will apply in addition 
to the name mask entered. Ths mob chosen will be selected from a MOBGROUP if one 
has been set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from those in the 
designated area (if one was designated) or the world. The mob must exist 
somewhere in the map for this command to work. If a room has been previously 
designated, then this command will bring the mob to that room. If a room or area 
has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a new 
room and area. </P>
<P>SET MOBTYPE ([CLASS]) - will set the current mob to one 
with the given class name. Ths mob chosen will be selected from a MOBGROUP if 
one has been set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from those in the 
designated area (if one was designated) or the world. The mob must exist 
somewhere in the map for this command to work. If a room has been previously 
designated, then this command will bring the mob to that room. If a room or area 
has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a new 
room and area. </P>
<P>SET ITEM ([ITEM NAME]) - will set the current item to 
one with the given name. The item chosen will be selected from those in the 
designated area (if one was designated) or the world. The item must exist 
somewhere in a room on the map for this command to work. If a room has been 
previously designated, then this command will bring the item to that room. If a 
room or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will 
designate a new room and area. </P>
<P>SET ITEMTYPE ([CLASS]) - will set the current item to 
one with the given class name. The item chosen will be selected from those in 
the designated area (if one was designated) or the world. The item must exist 
somewhere in a room on the map for this command to work. If a room has been 
previously designated, then this command will bring the item to that room. If a 
room or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will 
designate a new room and area. </P>
<P>LOAD MOB [MOB NAME] - will instantiate a mob of the 
given name from the list of mobs imported using the IMPORT MOBS command above. 
If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask similar in functionality to the one 
described in the Prop_HaveZapper will apply in addition to the name mask 
entered. This selected mob will be set as the current mob. If a room has been 
previously designated, then this command will create the mob in that room. If a 
room or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will 
designate a random room and area. </P>
<P>LOAD ITEM [ITEM NAME] - will instantiate an item of the 
given name from the list of items imported using the IMPORT ITEMS command above. 
This item will be set as the current item. If a room has been previously 
designated, then this command will create the item in that room. If a room or 
area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate 
a random room and area. GIVE ITEM - will give the currently designated item 
(designated using the SET ITEM, or LOAD ITEM command) to the currently 
designated mob (designated using the SET MOB, or LOAD MOB command). </P>
<P>GIVE BEHAVIOR [BEHAVIOR ID] [PARAMETERS] - The behavior 
ID must be a valid behavior class name. The parameters are any parameters you 
wish to pass to the behavior. This command will give the currently designated 
mob, item, or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands) the above 
behavior. GIVE ABILITY [ABILITY ID] [PARAMETERS] - The ability ID must be a 
valid ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to 
the ability. This command will give the currently designated mob, or mobgroup 
(designated using the set or load commands) the above ability. </P>
<P>GIVE AFFECT [ABILITY ID] [PARAMETERS] - The ability ID 
must be a valid ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish 
to pass to the ability. This command will give the currently designated mob, 
item, or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands) the above affect. 
</P>
<P>GIVE FOLLOWER [MOB NAME] - The mob name is a mob which 
will be selected from the list of previously designated mobs (designated using 
the load or set mob commands). This mob will be made into a follower of the 
CURRENTLY designated mob. This command does not change the current mob 
designation, nor does it change the location of either mob. </P>
<P><FONT color=#4169e1 size=4><STRONG>Final Quest Notes:</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>This stuff may seem complicated, but just make sure you 
carefully examine the sample quests found in the CoffeeMud resources directory! 
Also, remember that quest script errors are always sent out to your mud.log, so 
check their often when starting up a new quest!</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><A name=appf><STRONG><FONT color=#008000 size=5>Appendix F: Socials</FONT></STRONG></A></P>
<P>Socials are those miscellaneous and happy little emoting 
blurbs that help make muds a more fun and realistic place for players to 
interact.&nbsp; Without them, players couldn't smile, roll their eyes, or flip 
anyone off without considerable typing.&nbsp; The command line includes a social 
creator and editor:</P>
<P><STRONG>CREATE SOCIAL 
TWIGGLE</STRONG><BR><BR>This starts 
the creation process for a social called TWIGGLE.&nbsp; There are actually three 
different kinds of TWIGGLE we will make: TWIGGLE (no parameters), TWIGGLE SELF, 
and TWIGGLE (to&nbsp;a target).&nbsp; This is type 1 of 3.<BR><BR><EM>You wave 
your arms...<BR>Social name 'TWIGGLE' Enter new.<BR>:&nbsp;<BR></EM><BR>This is here in case you want to change the social name 
before you create it. Doubtful, so just hit ENTER and skip it.<BR><BR><EM>(No

T)arget, S)elf, N)one:&nbsp;</EM><BR><BR>This is where you choose the social type. For type1 
socials, this would be None.<BR><BR><EM>(No change)<BR>You see 'null'.&nbsp; Enter new.<BR>: 
<BR></EM><BR>This is what you as a 
player would see when you perform the social.<BR><BR><STRONG>You wiggle your 
toes.</STRONG><BR><BR><EM>Your action type=MOVEMENT<BR>Change 
W)ords, M)ovement (small), S)ound, L)arge Movement&nbsp;<BR></EM><BR>This is the requirement of 
the social. Small movement just needs hands, fingers, toes, lips, and other 
small body movements, while large movements require legs, and often moving the 
entire body. I tend to not use the Words one, and I leave sounds for, well, 
yelling and such. This particular social involves toes, thus it's a M)ovement. 
Type "<STRONG>M</STRONG>" for that.</P>
<P><EM>Others see 'null'.&nbsp; Enter 
new.<BR>:&nbsp;<BR></EM><BR>This is what the people in the room see when you perform a 
social.<BR><BR><STRONG>&lt;S-NAME&gt; wiggles &lt;S-HIS-HER&gt; toes.</STRONG><BR><BR>&lt;S-NAME&gt; means Source Name. 
Character performing the social is the source. I'll have a list of usable tags 
at the end of this tutorial for you.<BR><BR><STRONG>Others Effect type=HANDS<BR>Change W)ords, M)ovement (w/noise), S)ound, V)isual, 
H)ands:&nbsp;<BR></STRONG><BR>This is 
what others in the room need to be able to know you're performing a social. This 
social involves toe wiggling, so I would recommend Visual. If you're curious 
about Hands, that would be left for handshakes, highfives, etc.&nbsp;</P>
<P>And that concludes the creation of our TWIGGLE social, 
type 1.<BR><BR><STRONG>CREATE SOCIAL TWIGGLE SELF</STRONG><BR><BR>Ahh. Part 2, the SELF portion.<BR><BR><EM>You wave 
your arms...<BR>Social name 'TWIGGLE' Enter new.<BR>: <BR></EM><BR>Like the above, you don't need to change the name.<BR><BR><EM>(No

the social creation process. Enjoy creating your own socials, folks! To modify 
an existing social, purely use MODIFY SOCIAL [NAME] (i.e. MODIFY SOCIAL BONK, 
MODIFY SOCIAL HIGHFIVE &lt;T-NAME&gt;) or even MODIFY SOCIAL PAT SELF) What this 
does is it goes through the command list like you are creating that particular 
social, but with the information that is already stored on it. What you can do 
is just hit ENTER until you get to the part of the social you want to change and 
change it accordingly.</P>
