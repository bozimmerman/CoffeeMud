The purpose of this document is to cover aspects of CoffeeMud game
creation that are not directly related to Area/Map and Mob/Item
creation, which is
already covered in detail in the <a href="ArchonGuide.html">Archons
Guide.</a><br>
      <br>
      <p><a name="cmfs"><strong><font color="#008000" size="5">The
CoffeeMud File System (CMFS)</font></strong></a></p>
      <p>This is a complicated
topic, but one that all builders and
Archons should understand. Sooner or later, every CoffeeMud
adminstrator is going to want to modify some of the local files in the
CoffeeMud folder. This may include the quests, or skill lists, or
hopefully the intro.txt file located in resources/text directory!
Builders will also want to add files, including MOBPROG script files
that run in the Scriptable behavior, item and mob xml (*.cmare) files
for the
RandomMonsters behavior or for other scripts, Quest scripts, and other
things.</p>
      <p>Pretty soon, your
directories are packed with stuff customized
to your mud. This can create issues for back-ups, meaning that not only
do you have to back-up your database (or your data directory) but you
have to backup all those files that have been modified and added, since
they play as integral a role in your world as the rooms and areas do.
All those files can also create upgrade issues, as modified files can
get accidently overwritten when a new version of CoffeeMud is overlayed
in your installation directory. Lastly, this can create security
issues, as the builders might accidently delete the wrong file, or make
a mistake, creating problems for the admins as they try to recover.</p>
      <p>To help solve these
problems, the CoffeeMud engine uses a kind
of mirrored file system called <strong>CMFS</strong>
to store some files in your local directory (your hard drive), some
files in your database, and some files in both at the same time. When
the exact same file in the exact same directory is found in BOTH the
local file system and in the database, the one in the database is
always preferred. That way, should the file in the database (called a <strong>VFS</strong>
file) become corrupted or deleted, the one in the local file system
will remain safe. Furthermore, since files in the database (VFS files)
are always accessed before the same file in the local file system, you
can overwrite the files in the local file system with upgrades without
worrying about losing your changed files. And lastly, CoffeeMud
provides a security system that allows you to grant access to users on
a folder level, and also to specify whether the user can access the
local file system, or only the database VFS files and folders.</p>
      <p>The CMFS includes
everything in your CoffeeMud installation
directory/folder, and all the other folders therein. In fact, CoffeeMud
is utterly unable to access any files OUTSIDE of your CoffeeMud
installation folder, giving the server administrator an added level of
comfort. The CMFS is also able to access the VFS files in the CoffeeMud
database, and to give them preference over identically named files in
your local file system.</p>
      <p>CMFS employs the UNIX
standard for separating directorys and
folders. This means that the forward slash / character is used when
separating one folder from another when naming a file. The CMFS path <strong>/resources/text/intro.txt</strong>
would, for example, refer to the file called intro.txt inside the text
directory, which is inside the resources directory, which is in your
CoffeeMud installation folder.</p>
      <p>If that file had been
previously copied into the same
directory in the VFS database, then the CMFS would prefer that version
over the one that remains in the local file system. You may modify the
file <strong>resources/text/intro.txt,</strong>
update it, and save it without needing to remember that you are really
changing a file in the database. CoffeeMud will always remember to
prefer to the one in the VFS to the one on your local hard drive, if it
has been copied or saved there.</p>
      <p>If for some reason you
absolutely need to ensure that ONLY the
local file system version of a file or ONLY the VFS version of a file
is referenced by CoffeeMud, you may do so by prepending a special
string to your file paths. The string is double-colon :: to force
access of a VFS file, and double-forward-slash // to force access of a
local file system file. For instance, if the Scriptable prog
resources/progs/myprog.script is located in both your local and VFS
file systems, then you can force Scriptable to use the VFS version by
using <strong>::resources/progs/myprog.script</strong>
as your path
name. If you needed to force Scriptable to load the local file system
version of the file <strong>//resources/progs/myprog.script</strong>
would do the trick. Again, <strong>resources/progs/myprog.script</strong>
alone, without any special prepended file, will prefer the VFS file,
but will use the local file if a VFS file is unavailable. This is the
preferred behavior, so your Scriptable filenames should employ the
normal path naming standard except under very extraordinary
circumstances.</p>
      <p>Files can be copied into
the VFS from the local file system
using the Archon SHELL command. If you were to go into the coffeemud
resources folder using this command:</p>
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell cd /resources</font></strong></p>
      <p>if you now view the
directory</p>
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir</font></strong></p>
      <p>you'll see all the files
in your local filesystem in the
resources folder in your coffeemud installation directory. Now, you may
copy all of the files in this directory into the *same* directory in
the VFS database by entering:</p>
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell copy * ::/resources</font></strong></p>
      <p>the copy command here is
followed by a wild-card character,
the asterisk, to designate ALL files in the resources directory. The
next parameter is the destination folder. In this case, we specify our
destination as ::/resources, which would be the same directory, but in
the VFS system. Notice that we did not have to create a VFS folder
called /resources before we did this. The VFS always has a mirror copy
of all the local file system folders. However, it requires you to use
the SHELL COPY command to create a mirror of the files themselves. Now,
look at the directory again:</p>
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir /resources</font></strong></p>
      <p>We displayed the
directory this time using an absolute path
name, just to show you the syntax. You are still looking at the same
directory you saw when you entered <strong><font face="Courier New">shell
dir</font></strong>.
In fact, you can enter that command again to prove it. You'll see that
all of the files have little "+" marks next to them. This means that
the files exist both in your local file system *AND* in the VFS. Now
suppose we did something silly, like delete our local file system
version of resources/socials.txt. This could be done with the following
command:</p>
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell delete
//resources/socials.txt</font></strong></p>
      <p>Notice that we used the
double-slash // to designate that we
want to delete the LOCAL version. Had we not put those two slashes in
front, it would have preferred the VFS copy of socials.txt and deleted
that one instead. Now, look at the directory again:</p>
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell dir *</font></strong></p>
      <p>This time we displayed
the directory using an * wildcard, just
to demonstrate that we can use mask characters when displaying
directories. The command is doing the same thing the previous two <strong><font
 face="Courier New">shell dir</font></strong>
commands did, just in a different way. Now, you'll see that most of the
files still have the "+" sign in front, but now <strong>socials.txt</strong>
only has a "-" character. This means that the file exists only in the
VFS database, and not on our local hard drive. We can copy it back to
our local file system by doing:</p>
      <p><strong><font face="Courier New">shell copy ::socials.txt //</font></strong></p>
      <p>You'll see that I changed
the syntax of the copy command
around again to demonstrate some of the previous lessons. We use the ::
characters in front of the filename socials.txt to specify that we want
to copy the VFS version of the file. Since the VFS version is always
preferred and accessed first, the copy command would have worked just
fine without the two :: characters in front. The last parameter is just
two slash marks. When no directory or folder is specified, the default
and current directory is used. In this case, we only specified the two
slash marks to denote the local file system, and we did not specify a
destination folder. This means that the file socials.txt will be copied
into the current folder, on the local file system only.</p>
      <p>There are numerous other
shell commands you can make use of,
such as <strong><font face="Courier New">makedirectory</font></strong>
to create new folders, <strong><font face="Courier New">edit</font></strong>
to modify a text file, <strong><font face="Courier New">findfile</font></strong>
to hunt down a file with a given name, or <strong><font
 face="Courier New">searchtext</font></strong>
to find a file
containing a given text string. The shell command is a useful tool for
mirror your local files in your VFS database for safety, convenience,
and easy back-ups.</p>
      <p>If
you peruse the CMFS directories using either the shell command, or the
File Manager in the MUDGrinder, you will find that all of your local
files, and any VFS files you created are accessible side-by-side.
&nbsp;Poke around long enough, however, and you'll find one special
VFS
directory (/resources/catalog/...). &nbsp;This directory is created
by
the system to house read-only versions of the items and mobs in
your&nbsp;Catalog system as xml (*.cmare) files. &nbsp;These
files and
directories may not be modified or deleted, as they are only a mirror
of the catalog. &nbsp;See the Archon's Guide for more information
on
the Catalog system.</p>
      <p>The last topic concerning
the CMFS is about security. At the
top of this Guide, the subject of security codes was discussed. Well,
CMFS provides its own security codes to limit access to files and
folders in either the local file system, the VFS, or both.</p>
      <p>By default, a user is not
allowed to access any files in
either file system, unless they are an Archon or have been given a CMFS
security code. The two security codes are <strong>FS:
[ABSOLUTE_PATH]</strong>
and <strong>VFS: [ABSOLUTE_PATH].</strong>
In cmfs security codes, the [absolute path] is a path name starting
from inside your coffeemud directory, with no path-separating slashes
except to separate directories or to designate that the last file is
really a directory by using a trailing forward slash.</p>
      <p>For example, to give a
user access ONLY to files in the VFS
database folder /resources/text/, you would give the user security code
      <strong>VFS: RESOURCES/TEXT/</strong>
The user would then have permission to view or delete any of the VFS
database versions of files that have been copied into that directory
from the local file system. The user would also have permission to
create new files or create new directories in the VFS inside that
folder. Directories and files created by such a user, who only has a
VFS security code, would not create ANY files in your local file
system. All files would reside only in the VFS database. This user
would not even be able to copy existing local file system files into
the VFS to modify, since he does not have access.</p>
      <p>To give the same user
access to BOTH the local file system and
VFS versions of the resources/text directory, the security code would
need to changed to <strong>FS:
RESOURCES/TEXT/</strong> Using FS
instead of VFS gives the user access to both local and database
versions of those files.</p>
Of course, by default, an Archon has access to both versions of the
entire coffeemud installation folder. It would be as if the Archon had
the security code <strong>FS:</strong>
With
no directory specified, the Archon has local file system (and implied
VFS) access to the root directory and everything underneath it. For
that reason, when limiting access to the file system, it is best to use
the VFS: security code, and to always designate a limited directory
path in which your adminitrative user may play (upload their files,
save their scripts, etc). <br>
      <br>
      <strong><a name="ables"><font color="blue" size="5">Abilities
(Skills/Spells/Chants/etc..)</font></a></strong>
      <p>In the lexicon of the
Archons, the word "Ability" encompasses
a great many powers and skills, both natural and man-made. An ability
may behave as an Affect, as a Skill, or as Both.</p>
      <p>An ability behaving as an
Affect means that it is acting as a
discrete aspect of some existing thing, whether that thing is a room,
an exit, an item, or a mob. Such aspects may include the property of
great strength, great damaging ability, immunity to certain affects, or
simply the garbling of normal speech. An ability taking on this role is
both passive and reactionary; passive when it is embueing its host with
great strength or damage, and reactionary when it is providing immunity
or garbling speech.</p>
      <p>An ability that is
behaving as a Skill means that it allows
its host (which is always a MOB in this case) to interact with the
world around it, to change it, derive information from it, or beslow
Affects upon it. Such interactions can include kicking, making sick,
poisoning, identifying, catching on fire, and many other things. An
ability taking on this role is entirely active, though once the active
interaction ends, that same Ability may either end (as a kick), leave
itself behind on its target to remain as an Affect as described above
(as catching on fire would).</p>
      <p>CoffeeMud contains over a
thousand different java-coded
Abilities which fall into numerous other categories and genera of
various descriptions. The most important of those categories, however,
are their Ability Type. CoffeeMud has numerous different ability types,
which include Properties (which always act only as Affects), or Skills,
Spells, Prayers, Chants, Diseases, Poisons, etc. (all of which can act
purely as Skills, act purely as an Affects, or act as Both depending on
the context in which it is used). Whenever you place the name of an
ability in the Affects list of a mob, item, room, or exit, you are
telling CoffeeMud to use only the Affect/property aspect of that skill.
When you place the same ability name in the same mob's Abilities list,
you are telling CoffeeMud to reserve the ability for use as a Skill.
For example, when you add Spell_GiantStrength to a GenMob's affects
list, you are saying that this mob is permanently stronger than normal,
but when you place it on the GenMob's list, you are saying
that you want the mob to be able to invoke the skill at a later date
(by casting the spell).</p>
      <p>CoffeeMud also allows you
to define abilities outside of the
java-realm. This can be done from the command line using the CREATE
command. If you want to create a new skill called Poke, for instance,
you might enter:</p>
      <p><strong>CREATE
ABILITY Skill_Poke</strong></p>
      <p>And it would be done. The
"Skill_Poke" is the abilities
Ability ID. The fact that it starts with "Skill_" is merely for
descriptive purposes, and is not required. Generally speaking, it is a
good idea to give your abilities Ability ID's that start with the
general kind of ability it is, for instance "Spell_", "Chant_",
"Prayer_", etc.</p>
      <p>Whenever creating or
modifying a new ability, the Archon is
presented with a menu of selections and options available to customize
the class. Here is a description of those options:</p>

      <p>Although below the
consideration of the mighty archons, a
language is a series of noises or scribblings that mortals use to
communicate their ideas with each other. &nbsp;Like Skills and
Spells
above, Languages can be created by the Archons, and then assigned to
races, or allow them to be trained by players.</p>
      <p>By default, CoffeeMud
comes with several interesting languages
that players can speak using the SPEAK command. &nbsp;However,
CoffeeMud also allows you to define languages outside of the
java-realm. This can be done from the command line using the CREATE
command. If you want to create a new language called Boopsia, for
instance,
you might enter:</p>
      <p><strong>CREATE
LANGUAGE Lang_Boopsia</strong></p>
      <p>And it would be done. The
"Lang_Boopsia" is the abilities
Ability ID. The fact that it starts with "Lang_" is merely for
descriptive purposes, and is not required. &nbsp; Most languages do
not, for some unknown reason.</p>
      <p>Whenever creating or
modifying a new language, the Archon is
presented with a menu of selections and options available to customize
the class. Here is a description of those options:</p>
      <table style="width: 100%;" bgcolor="yellow" border="1"

      <strong><a name="craftskills"><font color="blue" size="5">Craft
Skills</font></a></strong>
      <p>Crafting Skills are
skills that players use to take raw
resources and turn them into useful things, like swords, armor, bags,
bowls, and so forth. &nbsp;These are skills like Cobbling,
Carpentry,
Weaponsmithing, etc.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Although CoffeeMud
includes a wide variety of configurable crafting
skills, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that you may want to
add onto them. &nbsp;Therefore,
CoffeeMud also allows you to define crafting skills outside of the
java-realm. This can be done from the command line using the CREATE
command. If you want to create a new craft skill called Mixologist, for
instance,
you might enter:</p>
      <p><strong>CREATE
CRAFTSKILL Common_Mixologist</strong></p>
      <p>And it would be done. The
"Common_Mixologist" is the abilities

&nbsp;An example of this would be cloth for the bandaging skills, a

skill components can be created using the CREATE command:</p>

they can be all required, or just some or one of them required. You can
also have some required by certain kinds of casters that are not
required by other kinds. &nbsp;The first menu is a list of each

      <strong><a name="classes"><font color="blue" size="5">Character
Classes</font></a></strong>
      <p>A character class is a
designation chosen by players that
limits the scope of skills and abilities they will have available to
them as they advance in level.</p>
      <p>CoffeeMud supports
several different class-systems through its
coffeemud.ini file (the CLASSSYSTEM entry). One such option is the
Single-class system, whereby the player can select a single class to
play throughout their characters gaming career. Another is the
Sub-classing system, whereby the player selects a parent-class to play,
but may add/change to any of that parent classes sub-classes to gain a
different selection of skills as they go forward in levels. A third is
the multi-classing system, whereby the player can select an initial
class, but may add/change to any other class to gain a different
selection of skills as they go forward in levels. The last option is to
disable the class system altogether, which essentially only means that
the player is not allowed to choose which class they play, but are
secretly forced into a single class that determines their skill
selection. See your coffeemud.ini file for more information on this
feature.</p>
      <p>CoffeeMud includes
numerous character classes by default that
give players access to the hundreds of skills in the CoffeeMud
codebase. However, they doesn't mean there isn't room for change,
improvement, or addition.</p>
      <p>Customized player or mob
classes can be used as skill
templates for mobs created using the Fighterness (or similar)
behaviors, or as genuine player classes for your game. Either way, here
is how it is done:</p>
      <p><strong>CREATE
CLASS Boxer</strong></p>
      <p>And it would be done. The
name Boxer is just an example. You
can enter any non-space string to serve as an official ID for your
character class. You can even specify the name of an existing code-base
class, such as Fighter or Mage. If you specify your own name, you are
creating a new class from scratch. If you specify an existing class
name, you are essentially "over-riding" that standard class. This can
be a quick and easy way to disable existing standard classes, since you
can create a generic character class called Fighter, for instance, then
set it so that players can not select it, which effectively disables
that character class.</p>
      <p>After a character class
is created using the CREATE CLASS
command, it can be deleted or modified later using the DESTROY CLASS or
MODIFY CLASS commands.</p>
      <p>Whenever creating or
modifying a new class, the Archon is
presented with a menu of selections and options available to customize
the class. Here is a description of those options:</p>

      <p><strong><a name="factions"><font color="blue" size="5">Factions</font></a></strong></p>
      <p>A faction can be viewed
very simply as a glorified tattoo with
a number value. Normal Tattoos are simply flags which a mob or player
can have: either you do or do not have the tattoo. A Faction is a kind
of flag a mob or player can have that has a special a numeric value
assigned to it. Another way to view a faction is as a relationship
between a mob or player and some idea, such as Goodness, Evilness, Orc
Affinity, Reputation, or some other idea. For example, in CoffeeMud, a
mob or players Alignment is implemented as a Faction. The Alignment can
be thought of as having a tattoo called alignment along with a numeric
value assigned to it. Alignment can also be thought of as the
relationship between the mob or player, and evilness, goodness, or
neutrality. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Before discussing the
nuts of bolts of the faction system, it
should be mentioned that CoffeeMud includes some automatic and built-in
factioning systems for you to use. &nbsp;In addition to the default
alignment system, there is also a mob reaction system controlled in the
coffeemud.ini file under the AUTOREACTION entry. &nbsp;This will
cause
mobs to react to players based on how their area, race, or other mobs
of the same name have been treated in the past. &nbsp;While killing
the
mobs will cause faction values to go down, making the mobs more likely
to mistreat the player, doing things like chatting with the mobs, just
hanging around their area, or even bribing them will make them happier.
&nbsp;The default settings for the three reaction systems is found
int
the resources/examples directory as areareaction.ini, racereaction.ini,
and namereaction.ini. &nbsp;You can also customize the systems for
particular areas, races, or mobs (depending on your system) by creating
a directory /resources/factions and adding to it a file called
race_&lt;racename&gt;.ini, area_&lt;areaname&gt;.ini,
or
name_&lt;mobname&gt;.ini with your designed faction definition.
&nbsp;You must replace any spaces with underscore _ characters.
&nbsp;If these files do not exist, the default configuration
mentioned
previously will be used for all areas, races, or mobs.</p>
      <p>The general faction
system in CoffeeMud is a powerful engine
for
defining what factions exist, how the factions are assigned, how the
value of factions rise or fall in value, how value changes are
reflected in other factions, and what impact the value of a faction has
on experience gain, ability usage, and ability skill gain. Since the
values of factions are available for use in Properties such as
Prop_WearZapper, Prop_ReqEntry, and all other features which respect
Zapper Masks, factions can also potentially impact which items can be
used, which rooms can be entered, the price of goods, the availability
of Deities, and many other things as well. As an example, the alignment
faction typically impacts all of the things mentioned above and more.</p>
      <p>Now, as was said before,
factions have numeric values. These
values can be positive, like 2389473, negative, or even 0. The range of
values which are valid for a given faction are defined by the limits of
the divisions or Ranges of a faction.</p>
      <p>A <strong>Range</strong>
is a numeric division of a faction
you have defined. A Range has a displayable name, a special unique code
name
for use in Zapper Masks, and of course a low and high value. A Range
can also be tied back to CoffeeMud's built in "virtue meter", which
allows you to define a Range as always granting the mob or player whose
faction value falls into that range goodness, evilness, or neutrality.
The lowest value of the lowest Range, and the highest value of the
highest Range define the overall limits of the values of the faction
itself. No player or mob may have a value for a faction which falls
outside those highest and lowest values of the highest and lowest
Ranges. For this reason, ranges are the most important part of a
faction.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect
are the range <strong>Change
Triggers</strong>.
One of the ways factions differ from simple tattoos is that CoffeeMud
can manage the rise and fall in the values of the faction on a given
mob or player automatically. The way these changes are triggered and
managed is first through Change Triggers, which are applied when both
the source and target of an action have standing or value in the
faction, and when the source and target are different creatures. Each
Change Trigger defines 1) What triggers the change (the Trigger), 2)
Whether value is gained or lost in the faction when the trigger occurs
(the Direction), 3) What percentage of the amount of change (after all
other modifiers) is applied to the value (the Amount Factor), 4)
several miscellanous flags to define the circumstances under which the
trigger is applied (the Flags), and 5) a Zapper mask to determine what
criteria the target of the Trigger must meet for this trigger to apply.
The valid Triggers include: Murder (and Murder2, ... Murder5) which is
triggered when the holder of this faction dies,
Kill (and Kill2, ... Kill5) which is triggered when the holder of this
faction kills another,
Time (a change occurs every 40
seconds or so), a type of skill being used, the domain of a spell being
cast, a flag associated with a skill being used, or Add Outsider, which
allows the faction to be added to those who do not have the faction, so
long as they meet the other requirements. Valid Directions of change
include: Up, Down, Opposite (opposite direction of the value of the
creature killed and proportional in value to the distance between the
faction value in the source and the target), Minimum (automatically
gains minimum value), Maximum (automatically gains maximum value), Add
(gains the faction if they don't have it -- useful with the Add
Outsider trigger), Away (gain if monsters value for this faction is
lower, lose if higher), and Towards (gain if monsters value for this
faction is higher, lose if lower). Valid Flags include: OUTSIDER, which
allows the trigger to apply even if the target of the trigger (not the
source) does not have standing in this faction, SELFOK, which allows
the trigger to apply even when the source or target are the same
person, and JUST100, which overrides the normal modifications of a
change (based on experience or other factors) and uses 100 points as a
base amount for the change from this trigger. Change triggers also
include
a mask, which refers to the target of an event, and can prevent the
event.</p>
      <p>Now, lets discuss how to
list existing factions:</p>
      <p><strong>LIST
FACTIONS</strong></p>
      <p>The list that is shown
with this command reflects the list of
those factions which have been loaded into CoffeeMuds memory. Factions
are loaded into memory when their identifiers/filenames are added to
the FACTIONS entry in your "coffeemud.ini" file. Factions may also be
loaded if a mob or player is loaded who has a faction which has already
been defined. Creating new factions, as you can now guess, is a two
part step. One step is to add its identifier/filename to the FACTIONS
entry of your "coffeemud.ini" file, after the file has been created. To
create the new faction identifier/filename, you must do the following:</p>
      <p><strong>CREATE
FACTION orc_affinity.ini</strong></p>
      <p>This command will create
a new file in your
CoffeeMud/resources directory or folder for the new faction. This file
will contain the default setting for your brand new faction, whose ID
(identifier) will be ORC_AFFINITY.CMVars. You will now be automatically
taken into the Faction Editor. If you had wanted simply to modify an
existing faction, you might have entered:</p>
      <p><strong>MODIFY
FACTION reputation.ini</strong></p>
      <p>The modify command will
take you into the editor for an
existing faction, regardless of whether it appears on the LIST FACTIONS
list, so long as the filename/identifier given refers to an existing
faction file. The Faction editor contains numerous other complex and
interesting fields to change, which we will now describe.</p>

      <p>Quests are tasks which
can be completed by players for prizes,
typically quest points, experience, money, or all three. Quest tasks,
the monitoring of their completion and status, as well as their
availability, can all be automated by CoffeeMud.</p>
      <p>The built-in Quest system
in CoffeeMud allows you to automatic
all of the following processes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>scheduling of quests
by a variety of means, and managing a
quest "duration"</li>
        <li>setting special
quest-start criteria based on the players
currently online</li>
        <li>the selection of
random mobs, items, rooms, and areas from
the map by various criteria</li>
        <li>the introduction of
new mobs and/or items from saved cmare
xml files, and thier automatic removal when the quest is done</li>
        <li>adding various skills,
affects, behaviors to any of the
aforementioned objects and their automatic removal when the quest is
done</li>
        <li>adding scripts to any
of the aforementioned objects and
having those scripts removed when the quest is done</li>
        <li>special variables and
designation for making your own logic
problem quests (mysteries)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The easiest way to create
a quest is to use the Quest Maker
Wizard, either from the Quest Manager in the MUDGrinder, or by entering
the command: <strong>CREATE QUEST</strong>
from the command line. The wizard will first allow you to select a
template basis for your quest. Templates will differ in several ways,
but the most important ones to watch out for are: what the player needs
to do to complete the quest, and which components of the quest are
created by you versus which make use of existing components of your
world.</p>
      <p>After selecting a
template, you will be taken through a series
of pages and asked to enter lots of little details about the new quest.
Hopefully the prompts are self-explanatory. Take special note when a
prompt designates special syntax for the expression of data -- not
following the rules can make the difference between a Quest working and
falling flat, leaving a nasty trail of error messages in your log. In
data dealing with the things mobs will announce or say, remember that
you can use any of the special codes described in the <a
 href="Scriptable.html#codes">Scriptable</a>
guide to insert data into
the mobs speech, such as <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">$i
$r $a</span>
and others. When you are done filling in all the fields, your new quest
will be ready for playing according to the timing you laid out. You can
also manually start your quests from the Quest Manager screen in the
MUDGrinder, or by using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">MODIFY
QUEST</span> &lt;quest
name&gt; command from the command line.</p>
      <p>If you have stretched the
Quest Wizard as far as it will go
and are ready to try your hand at poking around the innards of a Quest,
continue reading. Otherwise, you're done learning about Quests.</p>
      <p>A quest weaves its way
into your world through a long set of
definitions and pseudo-commands called a <span
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">QUEST-SCRIPT</span>.
The quest scripts
are manually created by an Archon using the <strong>CREATE
QUEST</strong>
[SCRIPT] command from the command line. Where [SCRIPT] is a either a
complete quest script, where each command line is terminated by a
semicolon (;), or a load command of the form LOAD=[SCRIPT PATH]. If you
enter a complete quest script, make sure that any embedded semicolons
are escaped like "\;". An example of a create script using a load
command (the more common case) is as follows:</p>
      <p><strong>CREATE
QUEST</strong>
LOAD=quests/murdermystery/murdermystery.quest</p>
      <p>All LOAD commands use the
resources directory inside your
coffeemud install directory as the default path. Therefore, if you
installed coffeemud in C:\CoffeeMud, the above LOAD command will look
for the file in
C:\CoffeeMud\resources\quests\murdermystery\murdermystery.quest.</p>
      <p>Quests may be started
automatically (autoquests) from inside
the quest script by including the SET WAIT and SET INTERVAL commands,
or they may be started manually by using the <strong>MODIFY
QUEST</strong>
[QUEST NAME] command.</p>
      <p>Quests can be listed, to
see their status, using the <strong>LIST
QUESTS</strong> command.</p>
      <p>Quests can be removed
from the list using the <strong>DESTROY
QUEST</strong> [QUEST NAME] command.</p>
      <p>Quests can be saved using
the <strong>SAVE QUESTS</strong>

Scripts</strong></font></p>
      <p>When creating a new quest
using the <strong>CREATE QUEST</strong>
[SCRIPT] command, whether you use the load command to specify an
external script, or include the script directly into the create
command, the quest script commands are as follows:</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET NAME</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[QUEST
NAME]</span> - the *unique*
name of your quest. This is a required command!</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET DISPLAY</span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);"> [DISPLAY QUEST NAME]</span> - a
friendly displayable name for your quest. &nbsp;Completely optional.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET DURATION</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[#TICKS/TIME]</span>
- Either a number of ticks (4 second periods) the quest will last once
started, or a formula, or a number followed by the word minutes,
seconds, hours, days, mudhours, or muddays. Use a simple
value of 0 to make your quest run continually. &nbsp;This is a
required
command!</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(51, 0, 0);"><span
 style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET WAIT</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[#TICKS</span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">/TIME</span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">]</span>
- Either a&nbsp;number of
ticks, or a formula, or a number followed by the word minutes, seconds,
hours, days, mudhours, or muddays to minimally wait between auto-starts
of the quest. This works in conjucton with SET INTERVAL. &nbsp;The full
wait time between quest starts is WAIT + (random number between 1 and
INTERVAL).&nbsp; Required for scheduled quests.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET INTERVAL</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[#TICKS/TIME]</span>
-&nbsp;Either a
number of ticks (1-#TICKS), or a formula, or a number followed by the
word minutes, seconds, hours, days, mudhours, or muddays to
additionally wait up to, after the official WAIT period above has
ellapsed, before&nbsp;starting the scheduled quest.&nbsp;
This works in conjucton with SET WAIT. &nbsp;The full wait time between
quest starts is WAIT + (random number between 1 and INTERVAL).
&nbsp;Required
for
scheduled quests.</p>
      <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);"></span>
      <p style="color: rgb(51, 0, 0);"><span
 style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET SPAWNABLE <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[TRUE/ALL]</span></span>
- whether this quest will, when started, spawn a copy of itself and run
the copy instead. This allows the same quest to run more than once at
the same time, though it will share its name as well as its list of
winners. If the ALL flag is given, the quest manager will attempt to
spawn off every single STEP of the quest all at once. This can create
chaos unless STEP BREAK is used instead of STEP. See information on the
STEP and SET PRESERVE commands below.<br>
      <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);"><br>
SET PERSISTANCE <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[TRUE/FALSE]</span></span>-&nbsp;a
quest with a scheduled WAIT/INTERVAL time will attempt to start after
the interval completes. &nbsp;If the quest then fails to start, it
will
then go back into a wait state before attempting to start again.
Setting PERSISTANCE to TRUE will cause that failed start waiting period
to be trivially start, in essence making the quest repeat its start
attempt over and over until successful. &nbsp;If PERSISTANCE is
FALSE
(the Default), the wait time will be the normal one determined by the
WAIT/INTERVAL variables.<br>
      <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);"><br>
SET DATE</span> <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[#DAY]-[#MONTH]</span>
- The real-life start-date of the quest. This is a valid substitute for
the SET WAIT requirement.</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(51, 0, 0);"><span
 style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET MUDDAY</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[#DAY]-[#MONTH]</span>
- The start
mud-date of the quest, according to the default global mud calendar.
This is a valid substitute for the SET WAIT requirement.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET MINPLAYERS</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[#PLAYERS]</span>
- Minimum number
of players who must be online for a timed quest to automatically start.
See SET PLAYERMASK.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET PLAYERMASK</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[MASKSTRING]</span>
- If this string is empty or not specified, then anyone is considered a
player for the purposes of the MINPLAYERS setting above. However, you
can specify a "zapper mask" to narrow down the definition of a player.
See HELP ZAPPERMASKS for the list of valid mask values to put here.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET RUNLEVEL</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[#LEVEL]</span>
- Normally, a timed quest will always run when its time comes up.
Setting a value above -1 will prevent this quest from running when its
time comes up if another quest is also running at the same or LOWER run
level. This does not affect spawned quest copies, which will always run
even when another of the same name (and runlevel) is active.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET PRESERVE</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[#STEPS]</span>-
If a number greater than 0 is issued, then when a STEP command is
encountered and the commands following it are executed due to a
MPSTEPQUEST Scriptable command, then any objects, behaviors, abilities,
or affects which are specified after the SET PRESERVE, but BEFORE the
STEP command will not be cleaned up by the quest manager until the
specified number of STEPS have been encountered and executed. This
allows, for instance, a mob, once appropriated and specified by a
quest, to continue being used in subsequent steps without being
restored by the quest manager to a natural state. An MPSTOPQUEST
command, or an expired duration, will always cause the entire quest to
cease executing and all objects to be cleaned up.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">STEP</span>
- The
purpose of this command is to allow your quest to run in several
different steps or stages. Placing this command in your quest script
will cause the script to end execution when it is encountered. The
quest will run normally until it is ordered to proceed with the next
step using the Scriptable command MPSTEPQUEST. When the MPSTEPQUEST
command is issued, the quest script will clean up any objects or data
defined by statements prior to this STEP command, and begin processing
new quest script commands which follow it. A SET DURATION command must
follow a STEP command in order to ensure that the quest will continue
to run following execution of the post-STEP commands, otherwise any
duration settings from previous steps will be re-used. Numerous STEP
commands may be places in your quest scripts. An MPSTOPQUEST command,
or an expired duration, however, will always cause the entire quest to
cease executing and all objects to be cleaned up. See also SET PRESERVE.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">STEP&nbsp;<span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">AUTO</span></span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">-</span>This
command is the same as the normal STEP command, except that when the
normal duration runs out, the next step is automatically executed.
&nbsp;The duration can still be short-cutted with MPSTEPQUEST or
MPSTOPQUEST as usual.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">STEP <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">BACK</span></span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">-</span>This
command is the same as the normal STEP command, except that it will
reset the script line pointer so that the next time the quest is
ordered to step again, it will repeat the given step. &nbsp;This
can
obviously cause an endless loop, but if you are using this command, it
is obviously your last command and endless repeating is your goal.
&nbsp;The use of this command is for two-step personal quests,
where
the first step sets up the environment, and the next step simply
applies new scripts to a given player. &nbsp;Since any number of
players may accept a quest, you would want this step repeated for each
player that accept, which explains the endless nature.</p>
      <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);"></span>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">STEP <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">BREAK</span></span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">-</span>
This command will cause the quest script to stop evaluating any further
settings. Statements after a STEP BREAK, including any SETS, LOADS, or
any other statements, will not be executed. This is used in conjunction
with SET SPAWNABLE ANY to allow quest scripts which have been broken
into several descrete steps to run independently. A SET SPAWNABLE ANY
quest is considered successfully run when this command is encountered.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">IMPORT MOBS</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[XML
FILE PATH]</span>
- this will import a list of custom mobs from a .CMARE file generated
using the EXPORT ROOM MOBS command. The parameter must be the path and
file name of the file, using the same format as the LOAD= command
mentioned above. This list can then be accessed with the LOAD MOB, or
LOAD MOBGROUP command.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">IMPORT ITEMS</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[XML
FILE PATH]</span>
- this will import a list of custom items from a .CMARE file generated
using the EXPORT ROOM ITEMS command. The parameter must be the path and
file name of the file, using the same format as the LOAD= command
mentioned above. This list can then be accessed with the LOAD ITEM or
LOAD ITEMGROUP command.</p>

 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">([AREA
NAME OR NAMES])</span>
- will set the current designated area to the area specified. Although
this does nothing in itself, it is important for the several commands
which load mobs and items. The area name ANY may be given to choose a
random area. Several area names may be specified as choices by setting
the first area name as ANY, followed by your other area name choices,
separated by spaces. If no area name is given, this will CLEAR the area
designation. This can have a profound impact on how subsequent mob or
item loading, or room setting commands work.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET AREA</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">[OBJECT]</span>
- serves the same purpose as the above command of the same name, but
the argument is an object specifier. See Object Specifiers below this
command listing. If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random
one from the group will be chosen.</p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">SET AREAGROUP</span> <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">([AREA
NAME OR NAMES])</span>
- essentially the same as set ROOMGROUP below, this will set the
current designated roomgroup to the rooms in the area(s) specified.
Although this does nothing in itself, it is important for the several
commands which load mobs and items. The area name ANY may be given to
choose a random area. Several area names may be specified, separated by
spaces and word-grouped with double-quotes. &nbsp;The area name ALL
may
be given to select all world areas. &nbsp;
If no area name is given, this will CLEAR the ROOMGROUP designation.
This can have a profound impact on how subsequent mob or item loading,
or room setting commands work. This command will automatically clear
the AREA setting.</p>

 style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">([ROOM
NAME])</span>
- will set the ROOMGROUP to the set specified. If an area has been
previously designated, and not cleared (see SET AREA), then the rooms
will be selected from the designated area according to the room name
criteria. Otherwise, rooms from the whole map will be chosen. If a room
name of ANY is given, then the rooms will be chosen randomly from the
world, or the area if designated. Several room names may be specified
as choices by setting the first room name as ANY, followed by your
other room name choices, separated by spaces.The room name ALL may be
given to select all designated rooms. &nbsp;
If no room name is given, this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP
designation (but it will not clear the area designation!). Valid room
names include map room IDs such as MyArea#123, or key words from the
titles or descriptions of rooms. &nbsp;Rooms designated this way

cause all rooms in that set (respectively) to reload from the database.
Doing either can be somewhat time consuming, and may disrupt any
players in the rooms affected, as it will cause items to vanish from

When LOAD= is used as a command inside a script, you can also specify
one or more space-delimited arguments which will be accessible inside
the target quest script as Object Specifiers. The first argument given,
whether it is itself an Object Specifier, or a simple string, will be
accessible inside the target quest script as ARG1, the second as ARG2,
and so forth. A special case exists, however, if one of the arguments
evaluates to an Object Specifier which represents a group of objects
(such as MOBGROUP or ITEMGROUP). If that case occurs, the LOAD= command
will execute once for every object inside the group! See the discussion
of Object Specifiers and Object Spcifiers in Parameters for more

In a quest script, anywhere the # sign is used above (such as [#TICKS]
or [#PLAYERS], you may enter a normal old every day number (34) or you
may enter a valid arithmetic expression using real or integer numbers
and any of the following operators: + - * \ () ?. The ? may be used to
generate random numbers in a math expression. For example, 1?4 would
generate a random number from 1 to 4, and 3+1?4 would generate a random
number from 4 to 7.</p>

Many of the SET ... commands, such as SET MOBGROUP, SET MOB, SET
ITEMGROUP, SET ROOM, etc, have forms which allow you to designate their
value using an [OBJECT] string. An [OBJECT] string is one of the
following basic quest-script values: "LOADEDMOBS", "LOADEDITEMS",
"AREA", "ROOM", "MOBGROUP", "ITEMGROUP", "ROOMGROUP", "ITEM", "ENVOBJ",
"STUFF", "MOB", or one of the following mystery quest-script values:
"FACTION", "FACTIONGROUP", "AGENT", "AGENTGROUP", "ACTION",
"ACTIONGROUP", "TARGET", "TARGETGROUP", "MOTIVE", "MOTIVEGROUP",
"WHEREHAPPENED", "WHEREHAPPENEDGROUP", "WHEREAT", "WHEREATGROUP",
"WHENHAPPENED", "WHENHAPPENEDGROUP", "WHENAT", "WHENATGROUP", "TOOL",
"TOOLGROUP". Using the SET command in this way allows you to either
COPY an objects value, or re-designate it for the purposes of one of
the GIVE ... commands. If the quest script was executed from inside of
another using the LOAD= script command, and arguments were specified
from the above objects, you may also have access to argument object
specifiers, such as ARG1, ARG2, ... ARGN. There will be one such object
specifier available for each argument passed to the script. Please note
that some object specifiers return single objects (such as MOB, ITEM,
ROOM) and some return collections of objects (such as ROOMGROUP,
MOBGROUP, ITEMGROUP). Object specifiers can also be combined using +
and - characters. For instance, MOBGROUP-MOB would return the group of
mobs in the MOBGROUP minus the specified MOB while the specifier
MOB+ITEM would refer to an object group containing both the specified
MOB and the specified ITEM.</p>

Object Specifiers in Parameters</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span>
When specifing parameters for the GIVE BEHAVIOR, GIVE ABILITY, or GIVE
AFFECT command, you may embed the names of one or more of the Object
Specifiers by prefixing the Object Specifier code string with a $
character, and concluding it with a space or other non-alphanumeric
character. For instance, the command: "give script
GREET_PROG 100\; say I love $MOB!!!\;~\;" would embed the name string
for the MOB object specifier inside the in-line script. In addition to
this capability, you may also put a special character after the $ and
before the object specifier to manipulate how the name of the object is
generated. Special characters are: '_' (to make the name in uppercase),
'&amp;' to remove any prefixed english article words from the name,
or
'|' to replace all spaces in the name with | characters (which is very
useful for QuestChat parameters).</p>

in Quest scripts:</strong></font></p>
      <p>The CoffeeMud quest
manager engine will allow you embed
Javascript into your quest scripts for the purpose of assisting in
setting up your quests. The Javascript must be located between the
&lt;SCRIPT&gt; and &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; quest script
commands to be
recognized.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: blue;"><font
 color="#000000"><font size="3">Javascript
is a wholly different language than the standard Scriptable/MOBPROG
language OR the quest script language described in this document. You
should read the JavaScripting section of the CoffeeMud</font> <a

 size="3">for
more information, as well as the following web sites
which discuss the usage and syntax of the Javascript language itself:</font>

      <font size="3">and</font> <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/"><font

 color="#000000" size="3">Aside from the above
information about
JavaScripting in CoffeeMud, there are still a few more details to learn
about JavaScripting in your quest scripts. Although</font></span><span
 style="font-size: 14pt; color: blue;"><font color="#000000" size="3">Javascript
does not require semicolon line delimeters and it will not likely cause
problems, you should be aware that the quest manager engine will strip
out all semicolons as part of its command parsing process. For this
reason, if you absolutely must keep a semicolon ANYWHERE in your
javascript, whether as part of a displayable string, or a line
delimeter, it must first be escaped: \;</font></span></font></span></p>
      <p>The quest manager engine
will also make a couple of useful
methods available to your Javascript for assisting in setting up your
quests. One is the <font face="Courier New"><font size="2">Quest
quest()</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman">method,
which, as you can see, returns a Quest object which represents to the
current quest script. The Quest object returned has numerous useful
methods on them for doing things like determining which mobs and items
were selected by the SET commands as described above (<font
 face="Courier New" size="2">isDesignatedObject,
getQuestStuff,
getQuestMob, getQuestItem</font>,
etc). There are also methods for
properly adding other such mobs and items to your quest (<font
 face="Courier New" size="2">runtimeRegisterObject</font>),
or for
adding abilities, behaviors, or effects to existing objects ( <font
 face="Courier New" size="2">runtimeRegisterAbility,
runtimeRegisterEffect, runtimeRegisterBehavior</font>).
You should
check out the Quest interface for more information on these methods;
they are located in the file Quest.java, which is in the
com/planet_ink/coffee_mud/interfaces package.</font></p>
      <p>Another method provided
to Javascript by the quest manager is
the <font face="Courier New" size="2">QuestState
setupState() <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">method. The
QuestState object made
available by this method contains information on the current state of
your quest Script. There are several useful properties of the object,
such as <font face="Courier New" size="2">area, room, mob, mobGroup,
item,</font> and <font face="Courier New" size="2">envObject</font>
which will refer to the last such objects SET by your quest script
before Javascript was executed. The Vectors</font></font> <font

Quest Notes:</strong></font></p>
      <p>This stuff may seem
complicated, but just make sure you
carefully examine the sample quests found in the CoffeeMud resources
directory! Also, remember that quest script errors are always sent out
to your mud.log, so check their often when starting up a new quest!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="holidays"><strong><font
 color="#008000" size="5">Holidays</font></strong></a></p>
Holidays are a special/reserved quest defined by file
/resources/quests/holidays/holidays.quest.<br>
      <br>
They are very simple Scriptless quests that can be started at random
intervals, or on certain mud dates, or real-life dates. The holidays
will only impact the areas specified by the holiday settings, and only
the mobs in those areas specified in the settings, and only with the
features you specify.<br>
      <br>
Use LIST HOLIDAYS to see a list of all defined holidays and the areas
hey are defined for. By default, 3 special-case weather related
holidays are included which impact any area that meets their special
criteria.<br>
      <br>
You can use MODIFY HOLIDAY &lt;name&gt; to change the settings
for a
holiday, DESTROY HOLIDAY &lt;name&gt; to delete one, or CREATE
HOLIDAY
name to create a new one that will automatically apply to the area the
creator is standing in when it is created.<br>

is type 1 of 4.<br>
      <br>
      <em>You wave your arms...<br>
Social name 'TWIGGLE' Enter new.<br>
:<br>
      </em><br>
This is here in case you want to change the social name before you
create it. Doubtful, so just hit ENTER and skip it.<br>
      <br>
      <em>(No change)<br>
Target=NONE<br>
Change T)arget, S)elf, A)ll, or N)one:</em><br>
      <br>
This is where you choose the social type. For type1 socials, this would
be None.<br>
      <br>
      <em>(No change)<br>
You see 'null'. Enter new.<br>
:<br>
      </em><br>
This is what you as a player would see when you perform the social.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>You wiggle your toes.</strong><br>
      <br>
      <em>Your action type=MOVEMENT<br>
Change W)ords, M)ovement (small), S)ound, L)arge Movement<br>
      </em><br>
This is the requirement of the social. Small movement just needs hands,
fingers, toes, lips, and other small body movements, while large
movements require legs, and often moving the entire body. I tend to not
use the Words one, and I leave sounds for, well, yelling and such. This
particular social involves toes, thus it's a M)ovement. Type "<strong>M</strong>"
for that.</p>
      <p><em>Others
see 'null'. Enter new.<br>
:<br>
      </em><br>
This is what the people in the room see when you perform a social.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>&lt;S-NAME&gt;
wiggles &lt;S-HIS-HER&gt; toes.</strong><br>
      <br>
&lt;S-NAME&gt; means Source Name. Character performing the
social is
the source. I'll have a list of usable tags at the end of this tutorial
for you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Others Effect
type=HANDS<br>
Change W)ords, M)ovement (w/noise), S)ound, V)isual, H)ands:<br>
      </strong><br>
This is what others in the room need to be able to know you're
performing a social. This social involves toe wiggling, so I would
recommend Visual. If you're curious about Hands, that would be left for
handshakes, highfives, etc.</p>
      <p>And that concludes the
creation of our TWIGGLE social, type 1.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><font style="background-color: moccasin;">CREATE SOCIAL
TWIGGLE SELF</font></strong><br>
      <br>
Ahh. Part 2, the SELF portion.<br>
      <br>
      <em>You wave your arms...<br>
Social name 'TWIGGLE' Enter new.<br>
:<br>
      </em><br>
Like the above, you don't need to change the name.<br>
      <br>
      <em>(No change)<br>
Target=NONE<br>
Change T)arget, S)elf, A)ll, or N)one:<br>
      </em><br>
Because this portion is the SELF portion, choose "<strong>S</strong>".<br>
      <br>
      <em>You see 'null'. Enter
new.<br>
:<br>
      </em><br>
This is what you see when you perform the social TWIGGLE SELF.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>You glaze over while
you try to wiggle your toes at
yourself.</strong><br>
      <br>
      <em>Your action type=MOVEMENT<br>
Change W)ords, M)ovement (small), S)ound, L)arge Movement<br>
      </em><br>
You need toes to wiggle them, right? <strong>M</strong>)ovement
for
that.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Others see 'null'. Enter
new.<br>
:<br>
      </em><br>
What the others in the room see when you perform the social.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>&lt;S-NAME&gt;
wiggles &lt;S-HIS-HER&gt; toes at
&lt;S-HIM-HERSELF&gt;. Very odd.<br>
      </strong><br>
      <em>Others Effect type=HANDS<br>
Change W)ords, M)ovement (w/noise), S)ound, V)isual, H)ands:<br>
      </em><br>
They need to see it happen, right? I would guess it's a <strong>V</strong>)isual
requirement.</p>
      <p>And that concludes the
creation of our type 2 TWIGGLE social.</p>
      <p><strong><font style="background-color: moccasin;">CREATE
SOCIAL TWIGGLE ALL</font><br>
      </strong><br>
Yay! Type 3! The ALL is the Target Name.<br>
      <br>
      <em>You wave your arms...<br>
Social name 'TWIGGLE' Enter new.<br>
:<br>
      </em><br>
I doubt you would still need to change the name. You have type one and
two. Why make 3 different?<br>
      <br>
      <em>(No change)<br>
Target=NONE<br>
Change T)arget, S)elf, A)ll, or N)one:<br>
      </em><br>
It's the ALL portion of social creation, so choose "<strong>A</strong>".<br>
      <br>
      <em>You see 'null'. Enter
new.<br>
:<br>
      </em><br>
What you would see when you perform TWIGGLE [Target] (ex: TWIGGLE
VIRAX).<br>
      <br>
      <strong>You wiggle your toes
at everyone. How wierd.</strong><br>
      <br>
The display would replace the tag with the appropriate name, and in
this example it would be Virax.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Your action type=MOVEMENT<br>
Change W)ords, M)ovement (small), S)ound, L)arge Movement<br>

      <br>
      <em>Others see 'null'. Enter

What those twiggled at people witness.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>&lt;S-NAME&gt;

      <em>Others Effect type=HANDS<br>

      <strong><font style="background-color: moccasin;">CREATE SOCIAL

      </strong> Yay! Type 4! The

      <br>
      <em>You wave your arms...<br>

I doubt you would still need to change the name. You have type one,

      <em>(No change)<br>

      <em>You see 'null'. Enter

      </em><br>
What you would see when you perform TWIGGLE [Target] (ex: TWIGGLE
VIRAX).<br>
      <br>
      <strong>You wiggle your toes
at &lt;T-NAME&gt;. How cute.</strong><br>

      <br>
      <strong>Sorry. They aren't
here for that lovely toe wiggle.</strong><br>
      <br>
This concludes the social creation process. Enjoy creating your own
socials, folks! To modify an existing social, purely use MODIFY SOCIAL
[NAME] (i.e. MODIFY SOCIAL BONK, MODIFY SOCIAL HIGHFIVE
&lt;T-NAME&gt;)
or even MODIFY SOCIAL PAT SELF) What this does is it goes through the
command list like you are creating that particular social, but with the
information that is already stored on it. What you can do is just hit
ENTER until you get to the part of the social you want to change and
change it accordingly.</p>

      <p>Polls can be an
entertaining and sometimes amusing way to
measure the thoughts of players. CoffeeMud supports single-selection
voting among options which you can designate. Polls are created with
the CREATE command, reviewed with the LIST command, modified with the
MODIFY command, removed with the DELETE command, and participated
during the login process and/or via the use of the POLL command.</p>
      <p><strong>CREATE

      <p>This command will create
a new blank poll. When a poll is

      <p>Clans serve many purposes
in the CoffeeMud engine. They
provide a way for multiple players to own property, conquer areas, and
exert control. They also provide a means of expressing politics between
themselves and other groups, or even with each other. Clans can allow
ranking players to order each other around, to create special magical
items, to keep a collective treasury, to collect taxes from other
players, and to override normal PK (playerkill) settings. Clans can be
tyrannical, run by a select few, run by elected members, or run
collectively. Clans can even be used as an alternative means of
learning new Classes. </p>
      <p>Players may belong, by
default, to a single clan from each
clan
category (which are inherited from their government by default).
Since (again, by default) there is only one category, players can
only belong to one clan. All of this can be changed of course,
starting with the numeric requirements defined by the MAXCLANCATS
setting. </p>
      <p>By default, clans can be
created and managed entirely by
players. This ability can be removed by disabling the several clan
creation and management commands from the coffeemud.ini file using the
DISABLE= field. Regardless, there is also an Archon mechanism for
creating and managing clans.</p>
      <p><strong>CREATE
CLAN &lt;clanname&gt;</strong></p>
      <p>This command will create
a clan with the given name. You can
then enter the following commands at any time:<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>DESTROY
CLAN &lt;clanname&gt;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MODIFY
CLAN &lt;clanname&gt;</strong></p>
      <p>When a clan modified, you
are presented with a list of
properties to fill in. Pressing enter will leave the property
unchanged. The properties include:</p>

      <p>You might want to read
the previous section on Clans before
proceeding.</p>
      <p>Clan governments provide
a
basic structure to clans, and serve a purpose similar to the one
Character Classes do for players. However, as clans are social
arrangements, most aspects of governments deal with the structuring of
these arrangements. </p>
      <p>By default, all
governments belong to a "blank" category, which
means that all governments are available for players to create clans
out of. Governments with other categories are available to players
as governed by the PUBLICCLANCATS setting. </p>
      <p>By default, clan
governments are defined in your resources
directory in the file clangovernments.xml. The Archon commands
available serve to modify this file.</p>
      <p><strong>CREATE
GOVERNMENT &lt;clangovtname&gt;</strong></p>

a new government with the given name. You can

 color="#008000" size="5">Achievements</font></strong></a></p>
      <p>Achievements are things that players can do for the bragging
rights, for some small reward, or for a Title. &nbsp;Things like
completing so many quests, training their stats up to unheard-of
levels, exploring most of the world, or killing so many worms can all
be considered achievements.</p>
      <p>The engine will track achievement progress as the player
plays. &nbsp;In some cases, the engine will notice achievement
immediately, while in most cases, the engine will not notice until a
periodic sweep is done every hour or so to check for achievement
progress and status. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>When a player completes an achievement, the fact of that
completion is recorded as a Tattoo on the players record. For this
reason, each achievement defined must have a unique Tattoo name. You
can see the achievement tattoo when you modify the player, and can even
add or remove them that way. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Achievements come in several different Event types, which
describe the general nature of the achievement and how it is attained.
&nbsp;These types are as follows:</p>
