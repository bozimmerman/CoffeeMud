Multi-User Dungeon like CoffeeMUD is a text based game where you create
and guide a heroic fantasy character on daring adventures that will
give you the experience to become even more powerful and
skilled.&nbsp;Your tasks will include exploring the world, defeating
dangerous creatures and enemies, completing quests, and crafting
helpful equipment-- all toward gaining levels of experience and
power.&nbsp;Along the way you may team up with fellow player
adventurers, become wealthy, build a home, join or form your own clans
and guilds, and even conquer entire areas to put them under your
control.<br><br>Your first step in this journey is to create a New
character. &nbsp;You will choose the race and gender of your hero, and
settle on your characters basic attributes, which will all
influence&nbsp;what kind of heroic archetype (called a Class) your
character will be. &nbsp;If you are just starting out, selecting an
Apprentice might be wise, as it lets you play around and learn a little
before choosing a permanent class, but Fighter is also considered an
easy class to slip into. &nbsp; Lastly you will choose an Alignment,
which lets you choose whether you consider yourself aligned with Good
or Evil creatures (or neither/neutral).<br><br>Upon entering the world
with your new character, you will find yourself in Mud School.
&nbsp;Reading the room descriptions and interacting with the world as
instructed will teach you all the basics. &nbsp;You will learn how to
LOOK at and READ things, move around using commands like NORTH, and
WEST, interact with objects using GET, DROP, WEAR, REMOVE, WIELD, and
HOLD, interact with creatures using SAY or CONSIDER, or engage in
combat with them using the&nbsp; KILL command. &nbsp; Commands like
SCORE, INVENTORY, EQUIPMENT, and ABILITIES will allow you to learn
about yourself and your skills.<br><br>The most important commands,
however, are HELP and OOC. &nbsp;The former gives you missing details
on commands and various topics, such as HELP KILL to learn more about
attacking. &nbsp;The later is for chatting with other players online,
and asking questions about good strategies and wise choices.<br><br></body></html>
