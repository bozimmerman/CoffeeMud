Following the Ability_ID is an<BR>optionally number in parenthesis, which would represent the minimum proficiency<BR>of the aforementioned Ability that is required. <BR>Example: <BR>Skill_Trip(50),Fighter_*(10) <BR>The above means that the current ability requires that the player have Trip at<BR>50% proficiency and any Fighter skill at 10% proficiency or better.</pre>

The catalog is a place where you can store templates of mobs and items<BR>for reuse, or for quick global modification and analysis.  Mobs and items in<BR>your catalog can be changed globally simply by creating and then changing any<BR>instance of one of them.  You can create new instances of a cataloged object<BR>simply by entering CREATE &lt;cataloged object name>. Your catalog is keyed by<BR>name, so once the name of a cataloged item or mob is set, it should not be<BR>changed.  <BR> <BR>Cataloged items can be placed into categories by issueing the catalog category<BR>command before adding or modifying catalog entries.  Mobs and items so<BR>cataloged must still have a unique global name, but flagging them this way can<BR>make listing them must easier.  <BR> <BR>You may review the objects in your catalog using the catalog list command. You<BR>can also check the catalog synchronicity of the objects in your live rooms with<BR>scan, or your saved rooms with dbscan.  You can check for uncataloged objects<BR>in live rooms with the overlook parameter, or in your saved rooms with<BR>dboverlook.  <BR> <BR>You may delete an object from your catalog to stop using it as a global<BR>template. Deleting an object from the catalog only detaches instances of a<BR>cataloged object from all others, but does not destroy any actual instances. <BR> <BR>The catalog is also used to manage a global random item-drop table.  Items can<BR>be set to randomly appear in the inventories of selected mobs when those mobs<BR>are brought to life, or at the moment of their death. Use CATALOG EDIT &lt;item<BR>name> to change drop settings.</pre>

			<a name="CMFS"><B>CMFS</B></a>
			<pre>CoffeeMud File System <BR>The CoffeeMud File System is a means of accessing files inside your main<BR>CoffeeMud folder along side files stored in your CoffeeMud database.  Files in<BR>the CMFS can be stored either in the local file system, in CoffeeMud's<BR>database, or in both.  The CMFS sees both sets of files and folders/directories<BR>as if they were part of a single file system. <BR> <BR>Normally, the files required for operation of CoffeeMud, such as text files,<BR>class files, help files, images, and other files, are loaded from the<BR>appropriate directories on your LOCAL file system inside the main CoffeeMud<BR>folder.  If you installed CoffeeMud into D:\games\engines\coff, for instance,<BR>the file intro.txt (the intro screen) would be loaded from<BR>D:\games\engines\coff\ resources\text\intro.txt.  <BR> <BR>Under the CoffeeMud system, however, you should always think of your CoffeeMud<BR>folder as a file system unto itself.  The same file discussed above, even when<BR>referring to the local file system inside CoffeeMud, would be accessed using<BR>the path:  resources/text/intro.txt. You'll notice that the path separators are<BR>forward slashes / like in UNIX, instead of the normal back-slashes \ used in<BR>DOS.  This is the standard for the CMFS.  You'll also notice that the resources<BR>directory is accessed as if it were at the root of its own drive.  This is also<BR>part of the CoffeeMud File System.  Because of this, CoffeeMud is utterly<BR>unable to access any files outside of its installation directory.  Keep this in<BR>mind! <BR> <BR>Within this installation directory structure, CoffeeMud is able to store files<BR>both on your local file system drive, and in your database (VFS Files).  The<BR>VFS, or Virtual File System, refers specifically to files and folders which are<BR>saved in your database, and accessible through the MUDGrinder's File Browser,<BR>or the MUD's SHELL command (see HELP SHELL).  When the CoffeeMud directory<BR>structure is viewed through those two screens, files in the CoffeeMud database<BR>and files in the local file system are both viewable as if they were part of a<BR>single file system, the CMFS. <BR> <BR>The files referenced in CoffeeMud are case-insensitive, except where dealing<BR>with the local file system, where it may be case-sensitive depending upon your<BR>operating system.  Any filename or path may be preceded by a :: string to<BR>denote forced VFS/database access, or // to denote forced local file-system<BR>access.  When neither is specified for a given file path, the VFS file is<BR>always preferred over the local one. For instance, the path<BR>::resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY to a copy of the intro.txt file<BR>stored in the database as a VFS file. If that file is not in the database when<BR>the :: string is used, the file will not be found.  The path<BR>//resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY to the copy of the intro.txt file<BR>stored in the local file system, even if the same file appears in the VFS.  The<BR>path resources/text/intro.txt will use the copy of intro.txt stored in the VFS<BR>*if* it exists there, or the one on the local file system otherwise. <BR> <BR>The / character is always used to separate directory paths and folders, such as<BR>/resources/text/intro.txt would refer to the file down.txt in the text folder,<BR>which in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is located in the root<BR>directory. <BR> <BR>So, as we've seen, whenever you need to refer to a file in CoffeeMud, you<BR>should keep this system in mind.  Files which are part of your CMFS may be in<BR>the VFS database, or in the local file system.  They may even be in both! This<BR>system provides security for the server in which CoffeeMud is being run, and<BR>provides for the ability to grant folder-level (or even VFS-folder-level)<BR>security to builders and other administrative users.</pre>

			<a name="GENERATE"><B>GENERATE</B></a>
			<pre>Command : GENERATE <BR>Usage   : GENERATE [OBJ TYPE] [ID] (FROM [FILENAME]) ([VAR]=[VAL]...)<BR>([DIR]/[TARGET]) <BR>Example : generate area maze_dungeon from randareas/example.xml areasize=50<BR>"areaname= the test" level_range=10?20 aggrochance=50 theme=kobolds south <BR>Example : generate string list <BR> <BR>This command uses an xml file to generate random content for your mud.  This<BR>content can be anything from whole areas, to rooms, mobs, items, or simple<BR>strings. By default, the content is built from the file in<BR>resources/randareas/example.xml, though the builder may specify his or her own<BR>xml file path as one of the many arguments.  The arguments, briefly, are: <BR> <BR>OBJ TYPE: One of the following: AREA, ROOM, MOB, ITEM, SCRIPT, or STRING. <BR> <BR>ID      : one of the "id" xml attributes defined on any tag in the XML file.<BR>Use GENERATE STRING LIST for a list of all "id" attributes defined in your<BR>file. <BR> <BR>FROM "F": An optional argument to specify your own xml file, with the resources<BR>directory being the default root. <BR> <BR>VAR=VAL : One or more variables and their definitions.  Many tags will have a<BR>specific set of required variables which must be defined in order for the<BR>content to be generated.  Failing to specify one of the required variables will<BR>cause an error message listing the variables which must be defined, and the<BR>type of data required for the variable.  Variable types which list numbers as<BR>their data types may also have math expressions values (so you can use random<BR>numbers).  See the help on MATH EXPRESSION for more information on this.  In<BR>addition to required variables, you may also use the space to enter one or more<BR>"override" values.  Many object fields (such as LEVEL for mobs and items, or<BR>NAME, etc) as well as the XML id tags, can have their "random" values<BR>overridden by defining them using the generate command.  If you need to use a<BR>space in a variable value, enclose the ENTIRE definition in quotes, such as<BR>"areaname=the dungeon" instead of areaname="the dungeon". <BR> <BR>DIRECTION: This applies only to ROOM and AREA object types.  The object, if<BR>successfully generated, will be linked to the current room that the player is<BR>standing in, in the direction they specify. <BR> <BR>TARGET: This applies only to SCRIPT object types.  The script, if successfully<BR>generated, will be added to the target. <BR> <BR>In closing, the GENERATE command is an interesting way to deliver large amounts<BR>of dynamic content for your world, though it can never replace the caring touch<BR>of a real, creative builder.  If anyone is interested in writing their own xml<BR>content, please open up the /resources/randareas/example.xml file and begin<BR>reading. Use that file as an example on how to construct your own.</pre>

			<a name="GMODIFY"><B>GMODIFY</B></a>
			<pre>Command : GMODIFY <BR>Usage   : GMODIFY (AREA/ROOM/WORLD/PLAYERS) [FIELD=VAL](&&/||[...]) <BR>Usage   :         (CHANGE=[FIELD=VAL]) <BR>Example : gmodify area class=genmob&&name=the cityguard change=name=the guard <BR>Example : gmodify world class=[cs]GenMob&&name=[ss]city change=name=[ss] <BR>Example : gmodify world class=[cs]GenItem&&name=a rusty sword<BR>change=destroy=true <BR>Example : gmodify players charclass=Fighter <BR>Example : gmodify ? <BR>Short(s):  <BR>A command to select objects in a given area, room, or the whole world based on<BR>the specified field values, and optionally change some of those specified<BR>fields. <BR> <BR>Searching the entire world is implied, but the first parameter may be the word<BR>AREA or ROOM to narrow the search.  You may also enter WORLD to make the world<BR>search explicit. <BR> <BR>The next parameter is the search criteria.  The key phrase WHEN= may optionally<BR>precede it to make explicit that you are specifying the search criteria.  The<BR>search criteria fields may be separated by && strings to specify that all of<BR>the preceding criteria AND the next single criteria must be true.  The criteria<BR>fields may also be separated by || strings to specify that all of the preceding<BR>criteria OR the next single criteria may be true.  One of those strings must be<BR>present when specifying more than one criteria. <BR> <BR>Each field in the search criteria must be of the form FIELD=VALUE,<BR>FIELD!=VALUE, FIELD$VALUE, FIELD>VALUE, FIELD&lt;VALUE, FIELD>=VALUE, or<BR>FIELD&lt;=VALUE.  Where FIELD must be a valid search field.  Enter GMODIFY ?<BR>for a complete list of all valid fields.  Not all fields will apply to all<BR>object types, so take this into account especially when using &lt; or !=<BR>operators.  The operators are all normal except for the new one, $, which means<BR>that the value is really a regular expression. The VALUE portion of the<BR>criteria may be prefixed with modifiers, which include:  <BR>[ss] to specify that the value refers to a substring of the fields whole value.<BR><BR>[cs] to specify that the search is case sensitive (case insensitive is<BR>implied). <BR> <BR>The last parameter is the optional change specifications.  These specifications<BR>must be prefixed with the key phrase CHANGE=.  If these specifications are not<BR>included, GMODIFY will display the results of the search.  The change<BR>specifications are similar to the search criteria in that they consist of<BR>groupings of FIELD=VALUE separated by && strings.  Unlike search criteria,<BR>however, operators other than =, and strings other than || have no special<BR>meaning.  The fields, like in the search criteria, must be valid fields for the<BR>options selected by the search criteria.  A special field name "DESTROY", when<BR>set to true, will obliterate the item in question.  Otherwise, the ordinary<BR>fields on the object will be changed to the specified value UNLESS the<BR>following conditions are met: the VALUE portion of a field is prefixed with the<BR>modifier [ss], and the VALUE portion of an identical field in the search<BR>criteria was also prefixed with the modifier [ss].  Under those special<BR>conditions, instead of substituting the entire field value on the object with<BR>the new value, ONLY the portion of the string selected in the search criteria<BR>will be substituted. <BR> <BR>* Be very careful with this command! It is wise to try the command WITHOUT<BR>change= ... first, to make sure you are matching Exactly what you expect,<BR>before doing a change pass.</pre>

			<pre>In certain fields and specifications, CoffeeMud will allow you to enter a<BR>mathematical formula in place of a simple number in order to calculate a number<BR>at run-time.  This is useful for occasions where you want the number to have a<BR>random element, or where the value of the number is calculated based on certain<BR>variables only available at run-time. <BR> <BR>The formulas can be anything from a simple number, to numbers combined with<BR>mathematical operators + - \ *, grouped with parenthesis ( ), and may also<BR>include certain special operators. <BR> <BR>One special operator, ? , is for generating a random number (ex: 2?5 refers to<BR>a random number between 2 and 5).  Another special operator, >, is for bounding<BR>the result of an operation (ex: 5 * 10 > 10 will evaluate to the greater of 10<BR>or 5 * 10).  The &lt; operator does the opposite. The last special operators are<BR>=, which evaluates to 1 if values on either side are the same, and !, which<BR>evaluates to 1 if values on either side are different.</pre>

The first parameter specifies<BR>whether the items in the text file are to be merged with those in the entire<BR>world, in your current area, or just the room. The second parameter (CHANGE) is<BR>implied to be ALL unless specified otherwise. It denotes which fields in the<BR>existing items may be changed based on what changes are seen to the item inside<BR>the CMARE file.   The third parameter (ON) is implied to be ALL unless<BR>specified otherwise.  It denotes how an item in the CMARE file is matched with<BR>an existing item in your world.  If the listed fields from the CMARE file and<BR>the existing item are equal, the items will be considered a match for the<BR>purposes of merging.  The fourth parameter (IGNORE) is implied to be NONE<BR>unless specified otherwise.  It denotes exceptions to the (ON) parameter,<BR>namely which fields are allowed to differ between items in the CMARE file and<BR>an existing item in cases where they would otherwise be considered a match<BR>according to the (ON) parameter.  Matched items in your existing world, in<BR>every room, will be modified accordingly, and the room will be resaved to your<BR>database.  The log will reflect all changes made to your world.  Every room in<BR>every area in your world will be reloaded from the database prior to any<BR>evaluations or changes. <BR> <BR>When using a database as a source, the merge command will compare and match the<BR>database version of the room contents with the local world.  The user is then<BR>given the opportunity to make changes to the local world depending on<BR>differences. The merge requires DBCLASS, DBSERVICE, DBUSER, and DBPASS<BR>parameters be set.  The IGNORE parameters is a comma delimited list of fields<BR>to ignore when displaying differences.  To mask the types of objects checked,<BR>the user can specify mobs, items, or the whole rooms after the word database,<BR>and a zappermask can be included after the mask parameters.</pre>

			<a name="MQL"><B>MQL</B></a>
			<pre>MQL Stands for MUD Query Language.  It's purpose is to allow the Archon, or a<BR>random quest xml document, to select existing objects in the game, or the<BR>properties of existing objects.   <BR> <BR>The structure of MQL is similar to SQL in that all MQL statements are of this<BR>structure: <BR> <BR>SELECT: [property, property, ..] FROM [object set]  WHERE [object comparison<BR>(logic) object comparison] <BR>* note the colon : after the word SELECT above. <BR>UPDATE: [object set] SET [property=value, ...] WHERE [object comparison (logic)<BR>object comparison] <BR>DELETE: from [object set] WHERE [object comparison (logic) object comparison] <BR>* note the colon : after the words SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE above. <BR> <BR>The SELECT clause defines the properties you wish to be returned from the MQL<BR>statement. <BR>The FROM clause defines the set of objects that you might want to return the<BR>properties of. <BR>The WHERE clause defines the conditions under which any member of the set in<BR>the FROM clause may be included in the final results. <BR> <BR>A FROM clause can be a simple world set term, such as one of the following: <BR> <BR>* A CMFS file path to a CMARE file, such as ::/resources/map/plains.cmare <BR>* AREAS to use the set of all world areas <BR>* ROOMS to use the set of all existing world rooms <BR>* NPROOMS to use the set of non-property (Prop_RoomForSale) rooms. <BR>* ORPHROOMS to use the set of rooms without a link into them. <BR>* MOBS to use the set of all existing world mobs and player mobs <BR>* NPCS to use the set of all existing world npc mobs <BR>* ITEMS to use the set of all existing world items <BR>* PLAYERS to use the set of player mobs. <BR>* RESOURCES to use the set of resource items. <BR>* FACTIONS to use the set of game factions. <BR>* RACES to use the set of game races. <BR>* SHOPS to use the set of shopkeepers. <BR>* In case where a qualifying object is implied, AREA can be used to refer to<BR>that specific area. <BR>* Another SELECT: statement in parenthesis, such as: SELECT: name from (SELECT<BR>* from AREA) <BR> <BR>The FROM clause can also include narrowing suffixes.  A narrowing suffix comes<BR>after the simple term, and is separated from it by a backslash \.   For<BR>example, if your from clause looks like SELECT * FROM AREAS\ROOM  , then the<BR>ROOM portion is the narrowing suffix of the AREAS term.  You can also continue<BR>adding more narrowing suffixes as needed.  For example: SELECT * FROM<BR>AREAS\MOBS\EQUIPMENT  .  Each suffix narrows or alters the term immediate<BR>before it, and the entire FROM clause will end up reflecting the type of object<BR>described by the final term, whether it be simple, or a narrowing term. <BR> <BR>The following are useful narrowing terms: <BR> <BR>* AREAS to use the unique set of areas in which the prior term is located <BR>* AREA to refer to the area where the prior term is located <BR>* ROOMS to use the unique set of rooms in which the prior term is located, or<BR>which the prior term contains <BR>* ROOM to use the room in which the prior term is located. <BR>* MOBS, MOB to use the set of all mobs contained in the prior term <BR>* ITEMS, ITEM to use the set of all items contained in the prior term <BR>* OWNER to use the set of all item owners of the prior term, if it was items <BR>* EQUIPMENT to use the set of all  worn items of the prior term <BR>* SHOPITEMS to use the set of shopkeeper items <BR>* EXITS to use the set of applicable exits <BR>* PLAYER to use the player npc applicable <BR>* MOB to use the mob object applicable <BR>* NPC to use the npc mob object applicable <BR>* ITEM to use the item object applicable <BR>* EQUIPMENT to use the equipment item applicable <BR>* OWNER to use the item owner object for a prior item term <BR>* ABILITIES to use the list of abilities for the prior term <BR>* PROPERTIES to use the list of Property effects for the prior term <BR>* EFFECTS to use the list of effects for the prior term <BR>* BEHAVIORS to use the list of behaviors for the prior term <BR>* SHOP to use the shop object for the prior term <BR> <BR>Be careful when using narrowing terms to make sure they make sense for the term<BR>prior to them.  For example, if importing mobs from a cmare file, AREAS will<BR>not likely resolve to anything, since the mobs aren't in the world yet. <BR> <BR>The SELECT: clause can include one or more comma-delimited properties of  the<BR>objects in the from clause, or it can be an asterisk *, or a period ., to refer<BR>simply to the from objects themselves.  It can also be a string or numeric<BR>literal, or an XML tag when embedding MQL in a random quest document.   <BR>Different kinds of objects have different kinds of properties, so it is tricky<BR>to define precisely what a legal and illegal object property might be. <BR>Choosing incorrectly will usually just result in an empty string "". <BR> <BR>An example of a legal property might be the property CLASS, since it applies to<BR>everything from areas and rooms, to mobs, and items.  NAME is also a property<BR>that almost all objects have.  Beyond this. using the GMODIFY command might be<BR>the simplest way to get a list of valid properties for a specific type of world<BR>object, or objects imported from cmare files. <BR> <BR>As mentioned previously, SELECT: clause properties can be separated by commas<BR>in order to select more than one.  For example: SELECT: class, name FROM<BR>areas\mobs would show the class id and name of every mob in your game. <BR> <BR>SELECT: clauses can also include an AS qualifier for each property selected. <BR>This has only the effect of changing the apparent name of the property for<BR>other parts of the system.  For an example using the WHERE command to issue<BR>MQL: WHERE AREA SELECT: class as classid, name as mob_name FROM areas\mobs<BR>would show the same results as the previous example statement, but with<BR>different name tags for the class and name properties.  This might be important<BR>when using an embedded SELECT: statement as your FROM clause, since you can<BR>only select properties that the embedded clause has returned, by the names they<BR>were given. <BR> <BR>SELECT: clauses, similar to FROM clauses above, can include narrowing terms. <BR>Like FROM clauses, these narrowing terms are separated by backslashes \.  <BR>SELECT clauses, at the moment, only support one narrowing term: COUNT.  The<BR>purpose of the COUNT term is to report the number of times the value of the<BR>previous terms appears in the rest of the FROM: clause.  For example, suppose<BR>you wanted to know the number of times each mob name is used, to do that, you<BR>might enter SELECT: name, name\count FROM areas\mobs <BR> <BR>Lastly, SELECT: clause can contain aggregating prefixes before a property term,<BR>which will transform the final result set in some way by aggregating the rows<BR>according to the prefix.  Prefixes, like suffixes, are separated from the<BR>property term by a backslash \.  The value aggregating prefixes are: <BR> <BR>* MEDIAN to return only the median value of all the property terms in the<BR>existing result set <BR>* MEAN to return the mean value of all the property terms in the existing<BR>result set <BR>* COUNT to return the count of the number of  items in the result set <BR>* UNIQUE to include only one row where the property is of any given value <BR>* FIRST to include only the first row <BR>* ANY to include only a random row <BR> <BR>For example, to quickly count the mobs in your game, you might enter SELECT:<BR>COUNT\* from AREAS\MOBS <BR> <BR>The WHERE clause contains one or more conditions, which you can further compare<BR>using connectors like AND, OR, or parenthesis to group conditions together. <BR>Each condition consists of  two terms separated by a comparator.  Value<BR>comparitors include = (equal to), &lt;> (not equal to), > (greater than), &lt; (less<BR>than), >= (greater or equal), &lt;= (less or equal), IN (in a set or object group,<BR>or a substring of), or LIKE (matching a ZAPPERMASK). <BR> <BR>A condition consists of two property terms, similar to those described in the<BR>SELECT: clause above, except that condition terms can not use aggregating<BR>prefixes.  Narrowing suffixes, however, are permitted.  For example NAME =<BR>'Bob' is checking whether the NAME property of an item in the FROM clause is<BR>equal to the string literal "BOB".  If it is, when that condition is true. <BR>Putting it together then, to show the mobs in your game whose names are EXACTLY<BR>"BOB", you might do SELECT: * FROM areas\mobs WHERE name="BOB". This works<BR>because NAME is a property of every mob in the AREAS\MOBS from set, and can be<BR>compared with the word "BOB". <BR> <BR>Condition statements are grouped together into conditions using AND or OR.  For<BR>example, changing the above condition to WHERE name="BOB" OR name="JOE" would<BR>expand the number of possible results by one name.</pre>

It does this by<BR>tracking certain pieces of data which together may be taken as rather<BR>circumstantial evidence of someone multiplaying.  The definition of the numbers<BR>are as follows: <BR>SYNC - The number of commands entered by more than one member of an IP group<BR>within a single 4 second period.  <BR>SPEECH - This refers to SAY commands, broken into three sections.  The first<BR>number represents the number of SAY commands done in the same room with a<BR>player who has the same IP address.  The second number represents the number of<BR>SAY commands directed at another player.  The last number is the number of SAY<BR>commands total. <BR>SOCIALS - These are also divided into three numbers where, again, the first is<BR>the number of socials in the same room with a player with the same IP, the<BR>second being socials directed at another player, and the last being the number<BR>of total socials. <BR>CMD - The number of commands entered which are different than the previous<BR>command entered. <BR>ORDER - The number of times one of the players in the group gave an ORDER to<BR>another player in the group.

			<pre>Quests are defined as a definable tasks which are completed by players for<BR>prizes. These tasks, the monitoring of their completion and status, as well as<BR>their availability, can all be automated by CoffeeMud.  For help on the archon<BR>QUESTS command, do AHELP QUESTWINS. <BR> <BR>A quest is created using the CREATE QUEST [SCRIPT] command.  Where [SCRIPT] is<BR>a either a complete quest script, where each command line is terminated by a<BR>semicolon (;), or a load command of the form LOAD=[SCRIPT PATH].  An example of<BR>a create script using a load command is as follows: CREATE QUEST<BR>LOAD=/resources/quests/myquest.txt. To load one of the built-in quests, for<BR>instance, use CREATE QUEST LOAD=quests/robbed/robbed.quest. <BR> <BR>Quests may be started manually, or by making them autoquests using the SET WAIT<BR>and SET INTERVAL commands below.  Quests may be started manually by using the<BR>MODIFY QUEST [QUEST NAME] command.  Quests can be listed, to see their status,<BR>using the LIST QUESTS command.  Quests can be removed from the list using the<BR>DESTROY QUEST [QUEST NAME] command.  Quests can be saved using the SAVE QUESTS<BR>command.  Quests saved this way will be restored during the next CoffeeMud<BR>reboot.  <BR> <BR>When creating a new quest using the CREATE QUEST [SCRIPT] command, whether you<BR>use the load command to specify an external script, or include the script<BR>directly into the create command, the quest script commands are as follows: <BR> <BR>SET NAME [QUEST NAME] - the *unique* name of your quest. This is a required<BR>command! <BR> <BR>SET DURATION [#TICKS] - # of ticks (4 second periods) the quest will last once<BR>started. 0=eternal. This is a required command! <BR> <BR>SET WAIT [#TICKS] - minimum # ticks to wait between auto-starts of the quest.<BR>Required for auto-quests only! <BR> <BR>SET DATE [#DAY]-[#MONTH] - The real-life start-date of the quest. This is a<BR>valid substitute for the SET WAIT requirement. <BR> <BR>SET MUDDAY [#DAY]-[#MONTH] - The start mud-date of the quest, according to the<BR>default global mud calendar. This is a valid substitute for the SET WAIT<BR>requirement. <BR> <BR>SET INTERVAL [#TICKS] - random # ticks (1-#TICKS) to wait between auto-starting<BR>the quest, AFTER the WAIT period (see above) is over. Required for auto-quests!<BR><BR> <BR>SET MINPLAYERS [#PLAYERS] - Minimum number of players who must be online for a<BR>timed quest to automatically start. See SET PLAYERMASK. <BR> <BR>SET PLAYERMASK [MASKSTRING] - If this string is empty or not specified, then<BR>anyone is considered a player for the purposes of the MINPLAYERS setting above.<BR>However, you can specify a "zapper mask" to narrow down the definition of a<BR>player.  See HELP ZAPPERMASKS for the list of valid mask values to put here. <BR> <BR>SET RUNLEVEL [#LEVEL] - Normally, a timed quest will always run when its time<BR>comes up.  Setting a value above -1 will prevent this quest from running when<BR>its time comes up if another quest is also running at the same or LOWER run<BR>level. <BR> <BR>IMPORT MOBS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of custom mobs from a<BR>.CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM MOBS command. The parameter must be<BR>the path and file name of the file, using the same format as the LOAD= command<BR>mentioned above.  This list can then be accessed with the LOAD MOB, or LOAD<BR>MOBGROUP command. <BR> <BR>IMPORT ITEMS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of custom items from a<BR>.CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM ITEMS command. The parameter must<BR>be the path and file name of the file, using the same format as the LOAD=<BR>command mentioned above.  This list can then be accessed with the LOAD ITEM or<BR>LOAD ITEMGROUP command. <BR> <BR>SET AREA ([AREA NAME OR NAMES]) - will set the current designated area to the<BR>area specified. Although this does nothing in itself, it is important for the<BR>several commands which load mobs and items. The area name ANY may be given to<BR>choose a random area. Several area names may be specified as choices by setting<BR>the first area name as ANY, followed by your other area name choices, separated<BR>by spaces. If no area name is given, this will CLEAR the area designation. This<BR>can have a profound impact on how subsequent mob or item loading, or room<BR>setting commands work. <BR> <BR>SET AREA [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.  If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen. <BR> <BR>SET AREAGROUP ([AREA NAME OR NAMES]) - will set the current designated<BR>ROOMGROUP to the areas specified. Although this does nothing in itself, it is<BR>important for the several commands which load mobs and items. The area name ANY<BR>may be given to choose a random area. The area name ALL may be given to choose<BR>all world areas. Several area names may be specified as choices by setting the<BR>first area name as ANY, followed by your other area name choices, separated by<BR>spaces. If no area name is given, this will CLEAR the ROOMGROUP designation.<BR>This can have a profound impact on how subsequent mob or item loading, or room<BR>setting commands work. <BR> <BR>SET ROOMGROUP ([ROOM NAME]) - will set the ROOMGROUP to the set specified. If<BR>an area has been previously designated, and not cleared (see SET ROOMGROUP),<BR>then the rooms will be selected from the designated area according to the room<BR>name criteria. Otherwise, rooms from the whole map will be chosen. If a room<BR>name of ANY is given, then the rooms will be chosen randomly from the world, or<BR>the area if designated.  The room name of ALL will choose all rooms.  Several<BR>room names may be specified as choices by setting the first room name as ANY,<BR>followed by your other room name choices, separated by spaces.  If no room name<BR>is given, this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP designation (but it will not<BR>clear the area designation!).  Valid room names include map room IDs such as<BR>MyArea#123, or key words from the titles or descriptions of rooms. <BR> <BR>SET ROOMGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<BR>same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers<BR>below this command listing. <BR> <BR>SET ROOM ([ROOM NAME]) - will set the current designated room to the set<BR>specified. If a room or area has been previously designated, and not cleared<BR>(see SET AREA), then the room will be selected from the designated area<BR>according to the room name criteria. Otherwise, a room from the whole map will<BR>be chosen. If a room name of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen<BR>randomly from the world, or the area if designated.  Several room names may be<BR>specified as choices by setting the first room name as ANY, followed by your<BR>other room name choices, separated by spaces.  If no room name is given, this<BR>will effectly clear the room designation (but it will not clear the area<BR>designation!).   Valid room names include map room IDs such as MyArea#123, or<BR>key words from the titles or descriptions of rooms. <BR> <BR>SET ROOM [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen. <BR> <BR>SET ROOMGROUPAROUND [#RADIUS] ([ROOM NAME])- will set the ROOMGROUP to the set<BR>of rooms up to RADIUS rooms from the previously set ROOM. The rooms will be<BR>selected from the set of rooms which are up to RADIUS rooms away from the<BR>currently set ROOM (see SET ROOM/SET LOCALE). The radius must then be greater<BR>than 0.  If the following room name of ANY is given, then all rooms in the<BR>radius are grouped.  Several room names may be specified as choices by setting<BR>the first room name as ANY, followed by your other room name choices, separated<BR>by spaces.  If no room name is given, this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP<BR>designation (but it will not clear the area designation!).     Valid room names<BR>include map room IDs such as MyArea#123, or key words from the titles or<BR>descriptions of rooms. <BR> <BR>SET LOCALEGROUP ([LOCALE]) - will set the ROOMGROUP to the ones with the<BR>specified class name. If an area has been previously designated, and not<BR>cleared (see SET AREA), then the rooms will be selected from the designated<BR>area according to the locale criteria. Otherwise, rooms from the whole map will<BR>be chosen. If a locale name of ANY is given, then the rooms will be chosen<BR>randomly from the world, or the area if designated.  Several locale types may<BR>be specified as choices by setting the first locale type as ANY, followed by<BR>your other locale type choices, separated by spaces.  If no locale is given,<BR>this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP designation (but it will not clear the<BR>area designation!).  Valid locale names may be Locale class names such as<BR>MountainSurface, StdRoom, etc, or they may be locale types such as stone,<BR>wooden, underwater, mountains, etc. <BR> <BR>SET LOCALEGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<BR>same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers<BR>below this command listing. <BR> <BR>SET LOCALEGROUPAROUND ([#RADIUS] [LOCALE]) - will set the ROOMGROUP to the ones<BR>with the specified class name. The rooms will be selected from the set of rooms<BR>which areup to RADIUS rooms away from the currently set ROOM (see SET<BR>LOCALE/SET ROOM). The radius must then be greater than 0.  If the following<BR>locale name of ANY is given, then all rooms in the radius are grouped.  Several<BR>room names may be specified as choices by setting the first locale name as ANY,<BR>followed by your other locale name choices, separated by spaces.  If no locale<BR>name is given, this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP designation (but it will<BR>not clear the area designation!).   Valid locale names may be Locale class<BR>names such as MountainSurface, StdRoom, etc, or they may be locale types such<BR>as stone, wooden, underwater, mountains, etc. <BR> <BR>SET LOCALE ([LOCALE]) - will set the current designated room to the one with<BR>the specified class name. If a room or area has been previously designated, and<BR>not cleared (see SET AREA), then the room will be selected from the designated<BR>area according to the locale criteria. Otherwise, a room from the whole map<BR>will be chosen. If a locale of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen<BR>randomly from the world, or the area if designated.  Several locale types may<BR>be specified as choices by setting the first locale type as ANY, followed by<BR>your other locale type choices, separated by spaces.  If no locale is given,<BR>this will effectly clear the room designation (but it will not clear the area<BR>designation!).   Valid locale names may be Locale class names such as<BR>MountainSurface, StdRoom, etc, or they may be locale types such as stone,<BR>wooden, underwater, mountains, etc. <BR> <BR>SET LOCALE [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen. <BR> <BR>SET MOBGROUP (RESELECT) ([MOB NAME]) - will designate a set of mobs with the<BR>given name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described by the<BR>help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to the name mask entered<BR>before the MASK= string.  A mob name of ALL will select all appropriate mobs.<BR>The mobs chosen will be selected from those in the designated ROOMGROUP (if one<BR>is designated),  AREA (if one is designated) or the world. The mobs must exist<BR>somewhere in the map for this command to work.  Normally a mob will not be<BR>placed in the mobgroup if the mob has been previously set with SET MOB, or SET<BR>MOBTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional first flag which, if specified,<BR>designates that  mobs may be placed in the mobgroup even if previously set, so<BR>long as the RESELECT flag was also used in the previous SET MOB or SET MOBTYPE<BR>command. <BR> <BR>SET MOBGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<BR>same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers<BR>below this command listing <BR> <BR>SET MOB  (RESELECT)  ([MOB NAME]) - will set the current mob to one with the<BR>given mob name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described by the<BR>help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to the mob name entered<BR>before the MASK= string. Ths mob chosen will be selected from a MOBGROUP if one<BR>has been set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from those in the<BR>designated ROOMGROUP (if one is designated), or the AREA (if one is designated)<BR>or finally the world. The mob must exist somewhere one of those groups for this<BR>command to work. If a room has been previously designated, then this command<BR>will bring the chosen mob to that room. If a room or area has not been<BR>designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a new room and<BR>area.  Normally a mob will not be chosen by this command if the mob has been<BR>previously set with SET MOB, or SET MOBTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional<BR>first flag which, if specified, designates that a mob may be chosen if<BR>previously chosen, so long as the RESELECT flag was also used in the previous<BR>SET MOB or SET MOBTYPE command. <BR> <BR>SET MOB [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen. <BR> <BR>SET MOBTYPE (RESELECT) ([CLASS]) - will set the current mob to one with the<BR>given class name. Ths mob chosen will be selected from a MOBGROUP if one has<BR>been set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from those in the<BR>designated ROOMGROUP (if one is designated), AREA (if one is designated) or the<BR>world. The mob must exist somewhere in the map for this command to work. If a<BR>room has been previously designated, then this command will bring the mob to<BR>that room. If a room or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then<BR>this command will designate a new room and area.  Normally a mob will not be<BR>chosen by this command if the mob has been previously set with SET MOB, or SET<BR>MOBTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional first flag which, if specified,<BR>designates that a mob may be chosen if previously chosen, so long as the<BR>RESELECT flag was also used in the previous SET MOB or SET MOBTYPE command. <BR> <BR>SET MOBTYPE [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen. <BR> <BR>SET ITEMGROUP (RESELECT)  ([ITEM NAME]) - will designate a set of items with<BR>the given name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described by the<BR>help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to the item name entered<BR>before the MASK= string. A mob name of ALL will select all appropriate mobs.<BR>The items chosen will be selected from those in the designated ROOMGROUP (if<BR>one is designated), the AREA (if one is designated) or the world. The items<BR>must exist somewhere in the map for this command to work.  Normally an item<BR>will not be placed in the itemgroup if the item has been previously set with<BR>SET ITEM, or SET ITEMTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional first flag which,<BR>if specified, designates that items may be placed in the itemgroup even if<BR>previously set, so long as the RESELECT flag was also used in the previous SET<BR>ITEM or SET ITEMTYPE command. <BR> <BR>SET ITEMGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<BR>same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers<BR>below this command listing <BR> <BR>SET ITEM (RESELECT) ([ITEM NAME]) - will set the current item to one with the<BR>given name. The item chosen will be selected from those in the designated<BR>ROOMGROUP (if one is designated), AREA (if one is designated) or the world. The<BR>item must exist somewhere in a room on the map for this command to work. If a<BR>room has been previously designated, then this command will bring the item to<BR>that room. If a room or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then<BR>this command will designate a new room and area.  Normally an item will not be<BR>chosen by this command if the item has been previously set with SET ITEM, or<BR>SET ITEMTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional first flag which, if specified,<BR>designates that an item may be chosen if previously chosen, so long as the<BR>RESELECT flag was also used in the previous SET ITEM or SET ITEMTYPE command. <BR> <BR>SET ITEM [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen. <BR> <BR>SET ITEMTYPE (RESELECT) ([CLASS]) - will set the current item to one with the<BR>given class name. The item chosen will be selected from those in the designated<BR>ROOMGROUP (if one is designated), AREA (if one is designated) or the world. The<BR>item must exist somewhere in a room on the map for this command to work. If a<BR>room has been previously designated, then this command will bring the item to<BR>that room. If a room or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then<BR>this command will designate a new room and area.  Normally an item will not be<BR>chosen by this command if the item has been previously set with SET ITEM, or<BR>SET ITEMTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional first flag which, if specified,<BR>designates that an item may be chosen if previously chosen, so long as the<BR>RESELECT flag was also used in the previous SET ITEM or SET ITEMTYPE command. <BR> <BR>LOAD MOBGROUP ([#NUMBER]) [MOB NAME] - will instantiate all (or optionally, the<BR>given number) mobs of the given name from the set of mobs imported using the<BR>IMPORT MOBS command above. If the mob name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as<BR>described by the help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to the mob<BR>name entered before MASK= string. This selected mobs will be set as the current<BR>MOBGROUP. If a room, roomgroup, or area has been previously designated, then<BR>this command will create each mob in that room or random room in the area. If a<BR>room or area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will<BR>designate a random room and area.  This command will also designate the current<BR>mob to the last one loaded. <BR> <BR>LOAD MOB [MOB NAME] - will instantiate a mob of the given name from the list of<BR>mobs imported using the IMPORT MOBS command above. If the name ends with<BR>MASK=..., then a mask as described by the help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply<BR>in addition to the name mask entered. This selected mob will be set as the<BR>current mob. If a room, roomgroup, or area has been previously designated, then<BR>this command will create the mob in that room. If a room or area has not been<BR>designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a random room and<BR>area. <BR> <BR>LOAD ITEMGROUP ([#NUMBER]) [ITEM NAME] - will instantiate all (or optionally,<BR>the given number) items of the given name from the list of items imported using<BR>the IMPORT ITEMS command above. This items will be set as the current<BR>ITEMGROUP. If a room, roomgroup, or area has been previously designated, then<BR>this command will create the item in that room. If a room or area has not been<BR>designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a random room and<BR>area.  This command will also designate the current item to the last one<BR>loaded. <BR> <BR>LOAD ITEM [ITEM NAME] - will instantiate an item of the given name from the<BR>list of items imported using the IMPORT ITEMS command above. This item will be<BR>set as the current item. If a room, roomgroup, or area has been previously<BR>designated, then this command will create the item in that room. If a room or<BR>area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate<BR>a random room and area.  <BR> <BR>GIVE ITEM - will give the currently designated item (designated using the SET<BR>ITEM, or LOAD ITEM command) to the last designated mob or mobs (designated<BR>using the SET MOB, SET MOBGROUP, LOAD MOBGROUP, or LOAD MOB commands). <BR> <BR>GIVE ITEMS - will give all currently designated items (designated using the<BR>SET/LOAD ITEM/ITEMGROUP command) to the last designated mob or mobs (designated<BR>using the SET MOB, SET MOBGROUP, LOAD MOBGROUP, or LOAD MOB commands). <BR> <BR>GIVE BEHAVIOR [BEHAVIOR ID] ([PARAMETERS]) - The behavior ID must be a valid<BR>behavior class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<BR>behavior. This command will give the most recently designated mob, item, area,<BR>room or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or<BR>roomgroup the above behavior.  The parameters above are optional, and include<BR>any text that would be valid for the behavior id specified.  The text may also<BR>optionally include embedded references to other quest objects.  See below<BR>Object Specifiers in Parameters below for more information on using this<BR>feature. <BR> <BR>GIVE ABILITY [ABILITY ID] ([PARAMETERS]) - The ability ID must be a valid<BR>ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<BR>ability. This command will give the currently designated mob, or mobgroup<BR>(designated using the set or load commands) the above ability. The parameters<BR>above are optional, and include any text that would be valid for the ability id<BR>specified.  The text may also optionally include embedded references to other<BR>quest objects.  See below Object Specifiers in Parameters below for more<BR>information on using this feature. <BR> <BR>GIVE AFFECT [ABILITY ID] ([PARAMETERS]) - The ability ID must be a valid<BR>ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<BR>ability. This command will give the currently designated mob, item, room, area,<BR>or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or<BR>roomgroup the above affect. The parameters above are optional, and include any<BR>text that would be valid for the ability id specified.  The text may also<BR>optionally include embedded references to other quest objects.  See below<BR>Object Specifiers in Parameters below for more information on using this<BR>feature. <BR> <BR>GIVE FOLLOWER [MOB NAME] - The mob name is a mob which will be selected from<BR>the list of previously designated mobs (designated using the LOAD MOB, SET MOB,<BR>or SET MOBTYPE commands). This mob will be made into a follower of the mob most<BR>recently designated using the SET MOB, SET MOBTYPE, or LOAD MOB command. This<BR>command does not change the current mob designation, nor does it change the<BR>location of either mob. <BR> <BR>TAKE BEHAVIOR [BEHAVIOR ID] - The behavior ID must be a valid behavior class<BR>name. This command will take from the most recently designated mob, item, area,<BR>room or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or<BR>roomgroup the above behavior. <BR> <BR>TAKE ABILITY [ABILITY ID] - The ability ID must be a valid ability class name.<BR>This command will take from the currently designated mob, or mobgroup<BR>(designated using the set or load commands) the above ability. The parameters<BR>above are optional, and include any text that would be valid for the ability id<BR>specified. <BR> <BR>TAKE AFFECT [ABILITY ID] - The ability ID must be a valid ability class name.<BR>This command will take from the currently designated mob, item, room, area, or<BR>mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or roomgroup<BR>the above affect.  <BR> <BR>RESET- If a ROOM has been designated using SET ROOM, or by any other previously<BR>described method, this command will cause that room to reset, or re-load from<BR>the database.  If a ROOM is not currently set (or has been unset), but a<BR>ROOMGROUP or an AREA has been set, this command will cause all rooms in that<BR>set (respectively) to reload from the database.  Doing either can be somewhat<BR>time consuming, and may disrupt any players in the rooms affected, as it will<BR>cause items to vanish from the floor, and make players and mobs unable to move<BR>until the process is completed. <BR> <BR>&lt;SCRIPT> - This designates the beginning of embedded Javascript in your quest<BR>script.  The end is designated by a corresponding &lt;/SCRIPT> tag on its own<BR>line.  See the next section for more details. <BR> <BR>LOAD= ([QUEST FILE]) ([ARGUMENT] ... [ARGUMENT])  - This command will cause the<BR>specified external quest script file to be loaded and executed as if it were <BR>embedded at the current point in the script.  The  quest  filename is of the<BR>same format mentioned above.  When LOAD= is used as a command inside a script,<BR>you can also specify one or more space-delimited arguments which will be<BR>accessible inside the target quest script as Object Specifiers.  The first<BR>argument given, whether it is itself an Object Specifier, or a simple string,<BR>will be accessible inside the target quest script as ARG1, the second as ARG2,<BR>and so forth.  A special case exists, however, if one of the arguments<BR>evaluates to an Object Specifier which represents a group of objects (such as<BR>MOBGROUP or ITEMGROUP).  If that case occurs, the LOAD= command will execute<BR>once for every object inside the group! See the discussion of Object Specifiers<BR>and Object Spcifiers in Parameters for more information. <BR> <BR>&lt;OPTION> ([QUEST SCRIPT COMMANDS]) &lt;/OPTION> - Putting quest script commands<BR>inside of &lt;OPTION> tags means that, for every execution of the quest script,<BR>only ONE of the &lt;OPTION> tags will be have their script commands executed.  The<BR>one chosen will be selected at random.  If only one &lt;OPTION> tag exists, it<BR>will be chosen every time, of course. <BR> <BR>* Note About #.  In a quest script, anywhere the # sign is used above (such as<BR>[#TICKS] or [#PLAYERS], you may enter a normal old every day number (34) or you<BR>may enter a valid arithmetic expression using real or integer numbers and any<BR>of the following operators: + - *  () ? <BR> <BR>* Object Specifiers.  Many of the SET ... commands, such as SET MOBGROUP, SET<BR>MOB, SET ITEMGROUP, SET ROOM, etc, have forms which allow you to designate<BR>their value using an [OBJECT] string.  An [OBJECT] string is one of the<BR>following basic quest-script values: "LOADEDMOBS", "LOADEDITEMS", "AREA",<BR>"ROOM", "MOBGROUP", "ITEMGROUP", "ROOMGROUP", "ITEM", "ENVOBJ", "STUFF", "MOB",<BR>or one of the following mystery quest-script values:  "FACTION",<BR>"FACTIONGROUP", "AGENT", "AGENTGROUP", "ACTION", "ACTIONGROUP", "TARGET",<BR>"TARGETGROUP", "MOTIVE", "MOTIVEGROUP", "WHEREHAPPENED", "WHEREHAPPENEDGROUP",<BR>"WHEREAT", "WHEREATGROUP", "WHENHAPPENED", "WHENHAPPENEDGROUP", "WHENAT",<BR>"WHENATGROUP", "TOOL", "TOOLGROUP".  Using the SET command in this way allows<BR>you to either COPY an objects value, or re-designate it for the purposes of one<BR>of the GIVE ... commands.  If the quest script was executed from inside of<BR>another using the LOAD= script command, and arguments were specified from the<BR>above objects, you may also have access to argument object specifiers, such as<BR>ARG1, ARG2, ... ARGN.  There will be one such object specifier available for<BR>each argument passed to the script.  Please note that some object specifiers<BR>return single objects (such as MOB, ITEM, ROOM) and some return collections of<BR>objects (such as ROOMGROUP, MOBGROUP, ITEMGROUP).  Object specifiers can also<BR>be combined using + and - characters.  For instance, MOBGROUP-MOB would return<BR>the group of mobs in the MOBGROUP minus the specified MOB while the specifier<BR>MOB+ITEM would refer to an object group containing both the specified MOB and<BR>the specified ITEM. <BR> <BR>* Object Specifiers in Parameters. When specifing parameters for the GIVE<BR>BEHAVIOR, GIVE ABILITY, or GIVE AFFECT command, you may embed the names of one<BR>or more of the Object Specifiers by prefixing the Object Specifier code string<BR>with a $ character, and concluding it with a space or other non-alphanumeric<BR>character.  For instance, the command: "give script GREET_PROG 100; say I love<BR>$MOB!!!;~;" would embed the name string for the MOB object specifier inside the<BR>in-line script.   In addition to this capability, you may also put a special<BR>character after the $ and before the object specifier to manipulate how the<BR>name of the object is generated.  Special characters are: '_' (to make the name<BR>in uppercase), '&' to remove any prefixed english article words from the name,<BR>or '|' to replace all spaces in the name with | characters (which is very<BR>useful for QuestChat parameters). <BR> <BR>Mystery Objects in Quest scripts: <BR> <BR>In addition to the normal quest objects mentioned above, such as MOB, ITEM,<BR>ROOM and so forth, there are also extranous objects and groups intended for use<BR>when building logic problem mysteries.

Any removed items which are resettable<BR>will also return.  Any items or mobs which do not belong in the location will<BR>be returned to their proper homes. <BR> <BR>The reset rejuv room or area command will revive any dead mobs or resettable<BR>items at the location of the invoker.  Mobs that have wandered away will not be<BR>returned.  No other mobs or items in the room will be affected. <BR> <BR>The reset itemstats and reset mobstats commands serve a similar purpose.  Both<BR>will modify the vital statistics of all the mobs or items in the room, area,<BR>world, or catalog specified.  The statistics will be "normalizations" of vital<BR>combat scores based on the mob or items level, and the game engine's definition<BR>of nominal ratings for that level.  They will allow a "preview" of changes to<BR>be made by specifying the "nosave" parameter on the command line, which<BR>prevents permanent changes.  Area names may also be specified on the command<BR>line to cause the command to skip certain areas (for use with WORLD parameter<BR>only). <BR> <BR>Reset relevel is a dangerous but potentially time saving command to change the<BR>levels of all mobs and items in the same area as the user from falling within<BR>its current range of levels to a new range.  See help [areaname] to see the<BR>existing minimum and maximum levels of the area.  <BR>The reset password command will let you generate a random password for the<BR>given player or account and email it to their address on file, or change it to<BR>a neutral word when no email address is on file. <BR> <BR>You can also reload your ini settings, or the lists.ini file using reset<BR>inifile.</pre>

			<pre>These are lists the tasks which must be performed. Each task is separated by a<BR>"|" to mean that either of the tasks on either side of the "|" is sufficient,<BR>or a "&" to mean that both of the tasks on either side of the "&" is required<BR>and in that order.  The first task should be one of: SAY, PUTTHING,<BR>BURNMATERIAL, BURNTHING, EAT, DRINK, CAST, EMOTE, PUTVALUE, PUTMATERIAL,<BR>BURNVALUE, READING, or SOCIAL.  <BR>If a task requires assistance from the from others defined by the INCLUDE task,<BR>it should be prefixed with ASSIST or ASSIST# (e.g ASSISTSAY), where # is which<BR>(1..n) assistant must do the task. <BR>The tasks themselves must be of one of the following forms:  <BR> <BR>* SAY [TEXT] - the text specified must be said by the player.  <BR>For example: SAY "Allah is Great"  <BR>* TIME [HOUR] - the other tasks must be performed at the specified hour.  <BR>For example: TIME 3  <BR>* PUTTHING [THING NAME] [CONTAINER NAME] - an item of the type must be  <BR>placed in the specified container. For example: PUTTHING dagger pit  <BR>* BURNTHING [THING NAME] - an item of the type given must be burnt or set   <BR>afire. This is typically done with the FIREBUILDING skill.   <BR>For example: BURNTHING the ceremonial log  <BR>* EAT [FOOD NAME] - the specified item must be eaten.   <BR>For example: EAT holy pie.  <BR>* READ [ITEM NAME] - the specified item must be eaten. <BR>For example: READ holy book.  <BR>* DRINK [DRINK NAME] - the specified drink must be consumed. <BR>For example: DRINK holy fountain  <BR>* INROOM - the player must be in the specified room number, or the word  <BR>holy to designate a room with infused holiness.  <BR>For example: INROOM NewArea#123  <BR>* RIDING - the player must be on the specified mount.  <BR>For example: RIDING holy altar  <BR>* CAST - the player must cast the specified spell.  <BR>For example: CAST Prayer_Bless  <BR>* EMOTE - the player must emote the following thing.  <BR>For example: EMOTE kneels before the thrown  <BR>* SOCIAL - the player must use the exact social.  <BR>For example: GOODNIGHT &lt;T-NAME> or YAWN or GOODNIGHT * <BR>* PUTVALUE [MINIMUM VALUE] [CONTAINER NAME] - an item worth at least the  <BR>specified amount must be placed in the specified container.  <BR>For example: PUTVALUE coins pit  <BR>* PUTMATERIAL [MATERIAL TYPE] [CONTAINER NAME] - an item made of the  <BR>specified material must be placed in the specified container.  <BR>For instance: PUTMATERIAL cotton pit  <BR>* BURNMATERIAL [MATERIAL TYPE] - an item made of the specified material  <BR>must be burnt, such as using the FIREBUILDING skill. <BR>For instance: BURNMATERIAL balsa <BR>* BURNMATERIAL [MINIMUM VALUE] - an item worth at least the specified  <BR>amount must be burnt, such as using the FIREBUILDING skill. <BR>For instance: BURNVALUE "wooden statue" <BR>* RANDOM [PERCENTAGE NUMBER] - happens % of the time. <BR>For example: RANDOM 10 <BR>* CHECK [REQUIREMENT STRING] - Use this with care. This allows masks to <BR>be entered which the player must meet. The mask is a normal ZapperMask. <BR>* INCLUDE [MIN] [REQUIREMENT STRING] - Use this with care. This allows  <BR>1..MIN other nps, who match the masks to assist with ASSIST: tasks. <BR>* TIMEOUT [SECONDS] - How many seconds to complete each following task <BR>before the entire trigger state is reset. <BR>* SOCIAL [SOCIAL NAME] [SOCIAL TARGET] - the player does the specific  <BR>social with the specific target (or none). Targets like &lt;T-NAME>, etc. <BR>* SITTING 0 - the player must be sitting (the 0 is required!) <BR>* STANDING 0 - the player must be standing (the 0 is required!) <BR>* SLEEPING 0 - the player must be sleeping (the 0 is required!) <BR>* WAIT [#TICKS] - a pause of #TICKS is required -- this should be no  <BR>MORE than 10, to use multiple WAITs in a row for longer pauses. Also,  <BR>never make this the first possible trigger -- you always want this  <BR>between 2 things they must do (&). <BR>* YOUSAY - if the previous item was completed (&), then the person  <BR>doing the ritual will automatically say the text. <BR>* ALLSAY - if the previous item was completed (&), then everyone in  <BR>the room will automatically say the text. <BR>* OTHERSAY - if the previous item was completed (&), then everyone in  <BR>the room except person doing the ritual will automatically say the text. <BR> <BR>* When making ability components: if your task name ends with + (like SOCIAL+),<BR>then arguments from the task will be forwarded to the ability when invoked.</pre>

			<a name="SECURITY"><B>SECURITY</B></a>
			<pre>SECURITY in CoffeeMud is on a player by player basis.   <BR>SYSOP status is defined as the ultimate security to do anything, anywhere, at<BR>any time.  Access to all commands in all areas will be available.  SYSOP status<BR>is defined in the CoffeeMud ini file entry SYSOPMASK which establishes the<BR>player characteristics that designate SYSOPS. All players who meet the<BR>requirements of the mask are automatically SYSOPS. <BR> <BR>Players who are not SYSOPS may also be granted specific privileges.  Each of<BR>the privileges may be limited to specific areas, or available globally.<BR>Privileges are defined in the Security section of a players settings.  Each<BR>security code listed for a player may be either a list of security Groups, or a<BR>specific security code. <BR> <BR>Security GROUPS are also defined in the ini file.  A Security GROUP consists of<BR>a group name, and a set of strings or codes representing privileges for that<BR>group.  Each group is prefixed in the INI file with the "GROUP_".  However, you<BR>should not use the "GROUP_" when adding group priviledges to the Security field<BR>of a player.  For instance, if you have "GROUP_BUILDER" defined in the INI<BR>file, then you would add "BUILDER" to Security when modifying a player in order<BR>to make that user part of the BUILDER group.  The security codes which make up<BR>each group are implicitly global, but can be qualified as area-only using the<BR>keyword "AREA". <BR> <BR>The following are the default strings or codes which, when found in a players<BR>security settings or in a group definition, confer the listed privileges. Each<BR>of these settings may be entered as listed below, or prefixed with the word<BR>"AREA" followed by a space, followed by the key.  This has the effect of making<BR>that privilege only available in or at areas where the Player is listed in the<BR>areas "Staff" setting.  For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" by itself<BR>confers the global ability to use the ANNOUNCE command.  The security code<BR>"AREA ANNOUNCE" means that the ANNOUNCE command can only be used inside areas<BR>where the player is listed as Staff. <BR> <BR> <BR>ABOVELAW=Immunity to the Arrest behavior. <BR>AFTER=The ability to use the command of the same name. <BR>AHELP=The ability to access administrative help files. <BR>ALLSKILLS=This code gives the player access to ALL skills,songs,prayers,spells<BR>at their next login. <BR>ANNOUNCE=The ability to use the command of the same name. <BR>AS=The ability to use the command of the same name. <BR>AT=The ability to use the command of the same name. <BR>BAN=The ability to use the command of the same name, as well as DESTROY BAN,<BR>LIST BAN, and access the BAN MUDGrinder feature. <BR>BEACON=The ability to use the command of the same name. <BR>BOOT=The ability to use the command of the same name. <BR>CHARGEN=The ability to use the command of the same name. <BR>CLOAK=The ability to use the command of the same name, as well as see those who<BR>are cloaked. <BR>CMDAREAS=The ability to Create, Modify, and Destroy areas.

			<pre>Command : SHELL <BR>Usage   : SHELL [COMMAND] [PARAMETERS] <BR>Example : shell <BR>Example : shell ? <BR>Example : shell directory <BR>Example : shell cd /resources/text <BR>Example : shell copy thisfile.txt :: <BR>Example : shell del ::thisfile.txt <BR>Example : shell edit thisfile.txt <BR>Short(s): . <BR>This command allows the archon, and users with appropriate FS: and/or VFS:<BR>security flags to access the file system and/or the virtual file system.  See<BR>help on CMFS or VFS for the difference between the two. <BR> <BR>The commands are case-insensitive, except where dealing with the local file<BR>system, where it may be case-sensitive depending upon the host system.  As<BR>mentioned in the CMFS docs, filenames and paths may be preceded by a :: string<BR>to denote forced VFS access, or // to denote forced local file-system access. <BR>When neither is specified for a given shell command, the VFS file is always<BR>preferred. The / character is always used to separate directory paths and<BR>folders, such as /resources/text/down.txt would refer to the file down.txt in<BR>the text folder, which in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is<BR>located in the root directory. <BR> <BR>The shell command may be entered with no parameter to see the players current<BR>directory. When viewing directories, a "-" character will precede a file which<BR>exists only in the VFS system.  A "+" character will precede a file which<BR>exists in both the local file system and the VFS system.  Since folders always<BR>exist in the VFS, they will always be seen with the "+" character preceding<BR>them. <BR> <BR>The shell command can be used to create directories, delete files or<BR>directories, copy files, search for files with given names, search inside text<BR>files for a text string, display a text file, or edit a text file.  Many<BR>commands support a mask to limit the files displayed. The mask may include "*"<BR>characters anywhere in the string to match 0 or more unknown characters in the<BR>filenames.  A "?" character always matches a single unknown character in a<BR>filename.  <BR> <BR>See HELP CMFS for more information on CoffeeMuds file system.</pre>

			<pre>Command : STAT <BR>Usage   : STAT ((SKILL/STAT TYPE) [TARGET NAME])/([NUMBER]<BR>[DAYS/WEEKS/MONTHS/YEARS] <BR>Usage   : ... (/SKILLUSE/QUEST/AREA/CRIME)) (PLAYERS) <BR>Example : stat <BR>Example : stat 2 weeks <BR>Example : stat tom <BR>Example : stat equipment bob <BR>Example : stat combat bob <BR>Example : stat inventory bob <BR>Example : stat questwins bob <BR>Example : stat tattoos bob <BR>Example : stat titles bob <BR>Example : stat scripts bob <BR>Example : stat charstats bob <BR>Example : stat roomsexplored bob <BR>Example : stat factions bob <BR>Example : stat spell bob <BR>Example : stat skill hassan <BR>Example : stat chant hassan <BR>Example : stat prayer hassan <BR>Example : stat area midgaard <BR>Example : stat item my longsword <BR>Example : stat clan bob <BR>Example : stat fountain <BR>Short(s):  <BR>This command serves two purposes.  The first is to allow you to view a usage<BR>statistics report on your mud.  Entering STAT alone allows you to see<BR>information gathered since midnight.  You may also enter a number and a scale<BR>(days, weeks, months, or years) to view information going farther back.  Adding<BR>the PLAYERS flag at the end shows player stats instead of character stats for<BR>the min/avg online stat ONLY. <BR> <BR>STAT will also allow you to retrieve basic stat information on a player, mob,<BR>item, room, or exit in the game.  Entering STAT and the objects name brings up<BR>the most basic information.  Specifying AREA, MOB, ITEM, ROOM, or EXIT before<BR>the name will make the search more specific. Including a skill type before a<BR>mob or player name will list their abilities of that type.  Valid skill types<BR>include: SKILL, SPELL, PRAYER, SONG, TRAP, PROPERTY, "THIEF SKILL", LANGUAGE,<BR>CHANT, "COMMON SKILL", DISEASE, POISON.  You can also get special reports by<BR>entering one of the following before the name: EQUIPMENT, COMBAT, INVENTORY,<BR>STINK, DEITY, QUESTWINS, TATTOOS, TITLES, SCRIPTS, WORLDEXPLORED,<BR>AREASEXPLORED, ROOMSEXPLORED, ALIGNMENT, INCLINATION, FACTIONS, FACTIONID,<BR>FACTIONAMT, MATTRIB, OBJATTRIB, CLAN, CLANROLE, LEVELTIMES, POBJECTS,<BR>BUDGETRESETDATE, INVENTORYRESETDATE, and CHARSTATS.  As per the player version<BR>of this command, you can also use basic stats, such as: HITS, MANA, MOVE,<BR>HUNGER, THIRST, FATIGUE, MAXHITS, MAXMANA, MAXMOVE, MAXHUNGER, MAXTHIRST,<BR>MAXFATIGUE, STRENGTH, INTELLIGENCE, DEXTERITY, CONSTITUTION, CHARISMA, WISDOM,<BR>GENDER, PARALYSIS, FIRE, COLD, WATER, GAS, MIND, GENERAL, JUSTICE, ACID,<BR>ELECTRICITY, POISON, UNDEAD, MAGIC, DISEASE, TRAPS, MAXSTRENGTH,<BR>MAXINTELLIGENCE, MAXDEXTERITY, MAXCONSTITUTION, MAXCHARISMA, MAXWISDOM,<BR>REJUVRATE, AGE, DETECTION, DOUBT, FAITH, WEIGHTADJ, LEVEL, SENSES, ARMOR,<BR>DAMAGE, ATTACK, DISPOSITION, REJUV, WEIGHT, ABILITY, HEIGHT, XP (experience),<BR>XPFNL (experience for next level), and XPTNL (experience to next level),<BR>QUESTPOINTS, TRAINS, PRACTICES, and any factions shown in the score command,<BR>such as ALIGNMENT.  Many of the basic character stats, such as INTELLIGENCE,<BR>etc, can also be prefixed like CURRENT_INTELLIGENCE to ensure you are getting<BR>the fully adjusted value.</pre>

			<a name="TATTOO"><B>TATTOO</B></a>
			<pre>Tattoo's are intended to act as miscellaneous flags which players may obtain,<BR>not unlike a quest point.  These tattoo's can then be checked for as<BR>requirements to enter rooms or exits, or to possess certain items.  If the<BR>common account system is used, accounts can also have tattoos on them as well. <BR><BR>An example would be like this:  The completion of a specific quest occurs when<BR>Gunther defeats the evil sorcerer Nunder and enters his inner chamber (where<BR>all the treasure is hidden).  Entering this inner chamber automatically grants<BR>Gunther a Tatto called "NUNDERKILLER".  Now, elsewhere in the realm is the<BR>second quest where Nunder's apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and<BR>is up to no good.  However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice is<BR>operating, the system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other Area)<BR>requires that Gunther already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo.  If Gunther had<BR>not defeated Nunder and obtained the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo, he would not be<BR>allowed into the realm of Nunder's apprentice.</pre>
