			<pre>Behavior   : Drowness<BR>Targets    : MOBs<BR>Parameters : <BR>Example    : <BR>Description: <BR>The behavior of the drow differs slightly between males and females.  This<BR>behavior is therefore an entire kit, including weapons, armor, spells, and<BR>combat behavior.  DO NOT (I repeat) DO NOT use this behavior with any<BR>CombatAbilities derivitive, unless you want an unfair and utterly deadly<BR>opponent.  Also, do NOT add any equipment to the mob with this behavior.  The<BR>kit will supply the mob with weapons and armor.</pre>

After this behavior<BR>has triggered, it will often require a RESET for any level changes to the mob<BR>to take over. <BR>Use the proficient flag to make all skills at 100% instead of level-based. Use<BR>the offensive/.../mixeddefensive flags to influence skill choices. This<BR>behavior should not be used WITH any of the other CombatAbilities behaviors,<BR>such as Fighterness, Thiefness, Mageness, Clericness, Druidness, or<BR>CombatAbilities. It should be used alone on a mob.<BR>Also, be aware that this behavior will modify the mobs stats to better reflect<BR>the class, so any additions or removals of this behavior should be accompanied<BR>by a room reset after saving, and manually checking to make sure the combat<BR>stats are as desired.</pre>

All emote strings are<BR>separated by the semicolons shown above.  The first parameter can be empty for<BR>defaults, or may contain a setting for minimum ticks (min=10), maximum ticks<BR>(max=20), the percent chance of occurrence after the random number of ticks has<BR>expired (chance=25), a total number of occurrences before expiration<BR>(expires=0), a list of rooms where the emoter MUST be for the emoter to work<BR>(inroom=...), a tag to make the emote sound based (sound), a tag to make the<BR>emote smell based (smell), or a tag to make the emote broadcast to adjacent<BR>rooms (broadcast).  In the first example every 10-20 ticks, there is a 25%<BR>chance that the object with this property will select one of the emotes<BR>randomly and perform it for all those in the same room who can see it.  In the<BR>second example, a smell based emote will be performed 25% of the time, but will<BR>only emote 10 times before the behavior is removed from the object.  In the<BR>third example, there is a 100% chance that, if the object is in room Here#1 or<BR>Here#2, it will emote one of the two choices. In the fourth example, a sound<BR>based emote will be performed 25% of the time in the room of the behavior, and<BR>in any adjacent rooms.<BR><BR>You can also mix and match the types of emotes by putting the keywords SIGHT,<BR>SMELL, NOISE, and SOCIAL as the first word in each emote string.  This denotes<BR>the type of emote for the rest of the string.  The last example shows how to<BR>enter a mixed emote.</pre>

The parameters are all optional.  If the<BR>"health" parameter is given, then the mob will get a number of regen ticks<BR>equal to the number given.  For instance, if the value is 2, then the mob will<BR>regen twice per tick, a value of 3 means 3 times per tick, etc.  Values of 1 or<BR>less mean no extra regen ticks.  The "burst" parameter refers to bursts of<BR>extra speed to the benefiting mobs equal to the number given. For instance, if<BR>the value is 2, the mob will move twice as fast per tick, a value of 3 means 3<BR>times as fast, etc.  Values of 1 or less mean normal ticking applies.  Values<BR>for hits, move, and mana are similar to health, but will only give a burst or<BR>rejuvenation to that particular stat.</pre>

A chance percentage (1-100) parameter may be given to better<BR>randomize the opportunity.  A GROUP flag may also be included to make the mob<BR>join the targets group instead of merely following them out of the room.  The<BR>rate of non-grouping following is dictated by the min and max ticks.  The<BR>NOFOLLOWERS flag will make sure that this behavior does not trigger when the<BR>mob has someone following him/her. The WANDER flag may be added to allow the<BR>mob to leave their home area.<BR><BR>An item with this behavior will also follow mobs around, depending upon whether<BR>the INVENTORY flag is in the parameters or not.

It<BR>will also add random enchantments and curses to items a percentage of the time<BR>dictated by the echanted parameter (default=10).  Items are selected from the<BR>list on a pseudo-random basis, with the chance weighted in favor of the least<BR>valuable items in favor of the most valuable.  This is to decrease the chances<BR>of a plethora of Spidersteel swords.<BR><BR>The parameters before the semicolon describe the rate and amount of items<BR>generated.  The room or area will attempt to generate an item every (min) to<BR>(max) ticks, assuming the percent chance (chance) is made.

Duplicates are<BR>allowed unless (maxdups) is set to some value.  Items taken away will be<BR>replaced by this behavior, even if they are looted.  If the behavior is on a<BR>room, all items will be generated in that room.  If on an area, a random room<BR>in the area will be picked for the item. The TYPE of room in that area which<BR>will be selected for population may also be specified. -ALL to disallow all<BR>locales, followed by +AIR +CITY +JUNGLE (etc) to reallow certain locales. <BR>-CITY -UNDERWATER and others may be used to restrict certain locales.

If the parameter contains the name of<BR>a character class, the mob will only teach abilities of that class. *Any* class<BR>may always practice with a MOBTeacher, but the mob may only teach those<BR>abilities for the character class the parameters describe.  The classes listed<BR>by mob teacher are NOT base classes.  To have a teacher able to teach skills<BR>from an entire base class, all sub-classes must be listed. <BR>Percentages may be included inside the parameters as well.  The percentage will<BR>always apply only to the character classes or spells listed after the<BR>percentage, not before.  Encountering another percentage entry will override<BR>the previous.  A percentage will dictate the chance that a given spell will be<BR>known by the teacher, or the chance that a particular spell in a given<BR>character class will be known. <BR>Two flags can also modify your list.  The NOCOMMON flag prevents the teacher<BR>from teaching common skills, even if they would normally be on his list.  The<BR>NOEXPS flag prevents the teacher from teaching expertises, even if he would<BR>normally qualify for them.<BR>If this behavior has NO parameters whatsoever, the mob will teach all basic<BR>skills. Expertises will only be taught if the mob otherwise qualifies for them<BR>himself, and Character Class changes will only be taught if the mob is that<BR>class. </pre>

The "cut" that the money changer takes, in general,<BR>can be defined with the CUT parameter, by making CUT equal to a percentage.  If<BR>you wish, you can also define exchange rates for the several currencies in your<BR>system by setting each currency name equal to a percentage.<BR><BR>When dealing with intersteller currencies, there are two other parameters,<BR>which can be used to automatically calculate a scaled "cut" of the exchange<BR>based on how far away the exchanged currencies planet is from the money<BR>changers.  To do this, you can add spacemaxcut to denote the percentage to take<BR>when the currency is from an unknown or maximum distance, and spacemaxdistance<BR>to denote a percentage of the entire galactic radius to use as a maximum.</pre>

The<BR>'RESTART' parameter may be placed in the path to force the object to start the<BR>path from the beginning.  If no 'RESTART' parameter is given, the object will<BR>by default retrace their steps back to the beginning of the path.  The '.'<BR>parameter (a period) in the path will direct the patroller to pause one step at<BR>that point.  If any doors are encountered along the patrol route, they will be<BR>unlocked and opened by a mob.  Items will ignore doors. If a route of room ids<BR>is given, the patroller will automatically "track" from their current position<BR>to the next room on their patrol list, even if it is not adjacent. The diameter<BR>parameter should be enlarged when it is possible for the patroller to become<BR>more that 20 rooms "off track".<BR><BR>By default, rideable mobs and items will stop patrolling when they are ridden. <BR>Setting rideok to true will make it so that they continue their patrol even<BR>when ridden, though they can still be driven by passengers.

Allows<BR>the mobs to speak and respond to speech.  The chat.dat file, from which speech<BR>behavior is derived, contains many "templates" for different speech behaviors. <BR>MudChat will attempt to choose the correct speech behavior for the mob based on<BR>the mobs name.  This may be overridden by specifying a speech behavior in the<BR>parameters.  This behavior extends the basic functionality of MudChat in the<BR>following ways:<BR><BR>1. If the first character in the parameters is a plus-sign, then a semi-colon<BR>delimited list of chat data is expected, in the same format as is found in<BR>chat.dat.<BR><BR>2. If format#1 is used, the trigger pattern may be followed by a double-colon,<BR>and then immediately by a variable string.   This string will designate that<BR>the given pattern is only responded to for a given player ONCE.  The string<BR>will also be added to a list of strings under the players name in any Quest<BR>object. This list will then be available through a Scriptable QVAR function.</pre>

Of course, this behavior does not override the existing REJUV system<BR>for mobs and items, so if you would like to use the ResetWhole system<BR>exclusively, you should set the rejuv rate on all the mobs and items in your<BR>game to 0, which disables their internal rejuvenation.</pre>
