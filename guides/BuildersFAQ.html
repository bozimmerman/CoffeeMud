      <h3><a name="q00" id="q00">What should I know to run
a CoffeeMud?</a></h3>
      <p>Well, for starters, if
you're going to run it on your computer
and you don't know how to setup a firewall with port forwarding, you
will have a tough time (and our group isn't *really* a network support
group, so we're not top-notch at helping folks with their network
troubles).</p>
      <p>Secondly, if you plan to
do anything clever, different, or
otherwise doing anything that isn't using what is within the system
already, you will either need to know some basic Java coding OR be able
to bribe a Java savvy friend with beer.</p>
      <p>You should also have some
idea about what you want to have in
your game. Yes, I know this sounds obvious, but it gets overlooked.
CoffeeMud supports Fantasy based games, so you will want to bear that
in mind. In progress is support for Sci-Fi games, but it is a work in
progress that is in its early stages.</p>
      <h3><a name="q01" id="q01">Can I add Northeast,
southwest, etc?
What supports it?</a></h3>
      <p>Yes, haven't you read the
INI help descriptions yet?
DIRECTIONS=7 can be changed to DIRECTIONS=11, thereby enabling
Northeast, Northwest, southeast, and southwest.</p>
      <h3><a name="q02" id="q02">Where do suggestions,
questions, and
bugs go?</a></h3>
      <p>Well, best bet for
questions, suggestions, and bugs is to
email <a href="mailto:coffeemud@yahoogroups.com">coffeemud@yahoogroups.com</a>.
Many times people will expand on suggestions or have fixes for bugs for
you pretty quickly.</p>
      <h3><a name="q03" id="q03">Does CoffeeMud support
Remorting?</a></h3>
      <p>Yes, in its own way. Here
is the HELP REMORT entry:</p>
      <p>Remorting requires
careful planning and, if you don't have the
benefits of certain Druidic chants, lots of time. Remorting is done
through your children. Children are created by using the MATE social
with a member of the opposite sex while the both of you are suitably
undressed. If pregnancy occurs in the female, birth will occur some 10
mud-months following this. The child should remain in the mothers
inventory until it can walk, which occurs 9 mud- months following
birth. If the child is Christened by a Cleric with a player legal name,
and if the child remains as a follower of either the father or the
mother until it grows up, it will become a player, which occurs 18-27
mud-months after birth. If the child does not remain an active
follower, or if it is never Christened, it will grow up to be a mob, or
perhaps not grow up at all! Should the named child grow up, the child
will cease to be a following mob, and become a player which can be
logged-in as. The child may be a mixed breed of the mother and father
if one of them is a Human and the other is not. Racial benefits will be
split between the mother and father, though children will have a bonus
to their maximum stats when they become a player, making them a good
choice for playing!</p>
      <p>If you are looking for
that traditional remort concept
revolving around classes, it is not supported. But you can accomplish
that through setting the INI CLASSYSTEM=MULTI, then do a bit of code
changing within your class files. For example, you might have 'Super
Wizard' or something. In that class file:</p>
      <pre>public boolean qualifiesForThisClass(MOB mob, boolean quiet)<br />{<br /> if((mob.charStats().getClassLevel("Wizard")&lt;30)<br /> &amp;&amp;(mob.charStats().getClassLevel("Power Wizard")&lt;30))<br /> {<br /> if(!quiet)<br /> mob.tell("You aren't a master of wizardry yet.");<br /> return false;<br /> }<br /> return true;<br />}<br /></pre>
      <p>In that case, the player
would have to have 30 levels in both
"Wizard" and "Power Wizard" to qualify for the "Super Wizard" CharClass.</p>
      <h3><a name="q37" id="q37">How can I localize CoffeeMud to
translate it into other human languages?</a></h3>
      <p>Getting CoffeeMud 100% translated will be difficult, but
here's a quick way to get you the first 90% of the way there. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>First, copy the input parser file <span
 style="font-style: italic;">resources/parser_en_TX.properties</span>
into the same folder with a different language name, such as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">resources/parser_fr_CA.properties</span>
for Canadian French. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Next copy the output translation file <span
 style="font-style: italic;">resources/translation_en_TX.properties</span>
and rename the copy, just like you did with the input parser file.</p>
      <p>Open up coffeemud.ini file, find the entries for LANGUAGE= and
COUNTRY= and change them accordingly.</p>
      <p>Open up your copy of <span style="font-style: italic;">resources/parser_??_??.properties</span>
and scroll down until you see [command-word-processor] and a line
underneath it which says<span style="font-weight: bold;"> #autoignore
9999</span>. &nbsp;Remove the hash mark # so that it says&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">autoignore 9999</span>. &nbsp;Save the
file, we will edit it again later.</p>
      <p>Open up your copy of <span style="font-style: italic;">resources/translation_??_??.properties</span>
and scroll down until you see [session-translation] and a line
underneath it which says<span style="font-weight: bold;"> #autoignore
9999</span>. &nbsp;Remove the hash mark # so that it says&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">autoignore 9999</span>. &nbsp;Save the
file, we will edit it again later.</p>
      <p>Now log into your mud as your Archon and start entering
commands.&nbsp;As you enter commands and do things, the parser and
translation files will fill up with unlocalized strings that it
encounters. &nbsp;Early versions of this feature won't capture EVERY
string, only those designated as localizeable, but eventually every
string will be handled. &nbsp;When you are satisfied you've seen every
string and entered every command you want to localize, you can stop and
let your users take care of the rest.</p>
      <p>Last step (for now at least), is to re-open your parser and
translation property files and find the two sections we modified
earlier. &nbsp;You will see that those sections have been filled with a
whole much of lines like this: <br />
IGNOREWHOLE "You are now speaking @x1."<br />
IGNOREWHOLE "WIMPY"<br />
You want to change those lines to REPLACEEXACT commands, while being
careful to maintain case sensitivity, like this:<br />
REPLACEEXACT "You are now speaking @x1." WITH "Que vous parlez @x1."<br />
REPLACEEXACT "WIMPY" WITH "MAUVIETTE"<br />
      </p>
      <p>You can keep the AUTOIGNORE 9999 command at the bottom of the
list, and it will continue to add any new strings it encounters which
were missed the first time around.</p>
      <p>After
this, it gets easy, but tedious -- you'll need to localize all the
faction files (alignment.ini), all the help files, text files,
lists.ini, and all the other loose files.<br />
      </p>
      <p>For everything that the above does not catch, CoffeeMud
supports other languages through a translation
system which utilizes regular expressions. &nbsp;Again, read through
the files
resources/parser_en_TX.properties and
resources/translation_en_TX.properties. &nbsp;The former translates
text entered by the user, the later translates text sent TO the user.
&nbsp;Experimenting with these features will get you there, one phrase
at a time.</p>
      <h3><a name="q04" id="q04">Does CoffeeMud have a
Building Port?</a></h3>
      <p>No, there is no separate
port for world content creation. All
building tools are on-line realtime. It is easy to export and import
areas, so you can run more than one copy. This can be essential if you
are also making coding changes, which can be activated more quickly by
rebooting your mud than with online code reloads.</p>
      <h3><a name="q05" id="q05">Does CoffeeMud have any
other combat
options besides normal, queue, and manual?</a></h3>
      <p>Yes, CoffeeMud supports a turn-based combat system, though it
could use some feedback. &nbsp;The way it work is that every player or
mob that is in combat must wait their turn before they can perform
actions. &nbsp;During their turn, any ticking effects (such as poisons
or temporary shields) will resume ticking. &nbsp;Each player or mob can
only perform as many actions as they have action points, which is as
normal, though more painfully obvious when using the turn-based system.</p>
      <h3><a name="q06" id="q06">What databases can
CoffeeMud work with?</a></h3>
      <p>Anything JDBC or ODBC
friendly. It comes with a flat file system
called FakeDB so you don't have to setup a database if you want.
However, products like MySQL and HSQLDB make the system run much faster.</p>
      <h3><a name="q07" id="q07">How do Clans work?</a></h3>
      <p>First, you need to use
the '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clancreate</span>' command to
create a new
clan, during which you can give your clan a name, and decide how the
officers will be structured (tyrannically all the way to
democratically). You have to get at least MINCLANMEMBERS amount of new
members
before it will activate you (set in the INI file). Activation means you
will be visible in the listing, can buy land for the clan, can have
clan bank accounts, and can hire mobs, as well as have politics with
others.</p>
      <p>Once you've made your
clan, people can '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clanapply</span>' to
the
clan. Of course, the person has to be at least level MINCLANLEVEL (set
in the INI file). '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clanapply</span>'
can be done even if you're the only one
online. Clan bosses can set qualifications to the clan with the
'<span style="font-weight: bold;">clanqual</span>' command and both
bosses and lieutenants will see new
applicants
in their '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clandetails</span>' screen,
at which point, they can '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clanaccept</span>'
or
'<span style="font-weight: bold;">clanreject</span>' the player
(regardless of online status). Clan bosses can
also '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clanassign</span>' people roles,
such as treasurer, lieutenant, or even
boss. Clan bosses and lieutentants may, at any time, '<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">clanexile</span>' a
member -
as well as members can '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clanresign</span>'</p>
      <p>Once you're accepted into
a clan, you can use the clantalk
channel to talk to your clan, as well as use the 'Clan Home' and 'Clan
Donate' spells. The '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clanhome</span>'
location and the '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clandonate</span>'
location
can be set by bosses using the '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clanhomeset</span>'
and '<span style="font-weight: bold;">clandonateset</span>'
commands. Clan morgues can be designated with the '<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">clanmorgueset</span>'
command. Bosses and treasurers may deal with any Clan bankers and Clan
Postmen in your game. If MINCLANMEMBERS don't at least login in
DAYSCLANDEATH days, then the clan will be purged automatically.</p>
      <h3><a name="q08" id="q08">What does
Hunger/Thirst/Fatigue affect?</a></h3>
      <p>Neglecting to eat or
drink can put a player into a state of
hunger or thirst respectively. Failing to sleep for days on end can
cause fatigue. Each of these will lower attack rating, armor rating,
and damage capabilities. Hunger and Thirst will also decrease the rate
at which hit points, movement, and mana are regained. Lastly, remaining
Hungry or Thirsty for too long will result in death, though there will
be plenty of warnings from the system before it happens.</p>
      <h3><a name="q09" id="q09">Can I make rooms available
for players
to purchase? Can players have homes?</a></h3>
      <p>Yes. And there are a ton
of ways to do it. The most common way
is to create a special Area for player homes, put some rooms in it
which you want to be for sale, and then add either Prop_RoomForSale,
Prop_RoomsForSale or Prop_LotsForSale to each room as a property. Then,
in the same area (but not in one of your rooms for sale!), put a
shopkeeper that sells either Clan Homes/Land or Player Homes/Land. This
will force the shopkeeper to keep an updated inventory of titles to
rooms available for sale.</p>
      <h3><a name="q10" id="q10">How can I make mobs
talk/answer
questions?</a></h3>
      <p>Luckily, a great document
has already been provided for the
useful things which can be accomplished with the MudChat behavior. <a
 href="MudChat.html">Here it is.</a></p>
      <h3><a name="q11" id="q11">How do player Tattoos work?</a></h3>
      <p>Tattoo's are intended to
act as miscellaneous flags which
players may obtain, like a quest point. These tattoo's can then be
checked for as requirements to enter rooms or exits using
Prop_ReqTattoo, or using Prop_ReqEntry. Prop_HaveZapper and
Prop_WearZapper can also be used to check for tattoos.</p>
      <p>An example would be like
this: The completion of a specific
quest occurs when Gunther defeats the evil sorcerer Nunder and enters
his inner chamber (where all the treasure is hidden). Entering this
inner chamber automatically grants Gunther a Tatto called
"NUNDERKILLER" because Prop_TattooAdder was on the room as a property.
Now, elsewhere in the realm is the second quest where Nunder's
apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and is up to no good.
However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice is operating,
the system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other Area)
requires that Gunther already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo. If
Gunther had not defeated Nunder, he would not be allowed into the realm
of Nunder's apprentice.</p>
      <h3><a name="q12" id="q12">How do I make poisonous
drinks?</a></h3>
      <p>The best way to "mix a
drink" is to make a GenPotion item, and
add the relevant Poison_* as the potion spell effect. Another way is to
make a GenDrink item, add the Poison_ as an effect.</p>
      <h3><a name="q13" id="q13">How do I make other
Archons?</a></h3>
      <p>Using your existing
Archon, issue the command "create item
ManualArchon". Then have your other player get the manual and read it.</p>
      <h3><a name="q14" id="q14">How do I make materials
that the
Common Skills can use?</a></h3>
      <p>Make sure you create a
GenResource, GenLiquidResource, or
GenFoodResource item. Only items of this sort will be recognized as raw
materials by the common skills. &nbsp;This can be more easily be done
by entering CREATE 100 CORN, etc..</p>
      <h3><a name="q15" id="q15">Why don't my aggressive
mobs attack me?</a></h3>
      <p>Aggressive mobs don't
attack Archons, or anyone else with
CMDROOMS or ORDER security privileges.</p>
      <h3><a name="q16" id="q16">Why don't my
mobile/patrolling mobs
move?</a></h3>
      <p>Mobile mobs will not move
if an Archon, or anyone else with
CMDROOMS or ORDER security privileges is the in the same room as them.</p>
      <h3><a name="q17" id="q17">How do I import CoffeeMud
areas
(*.cmare)?</a></h3>
      <p>Check out the IMPORT
command. Logged in as your Archon, enter AHELP IMPORT.</p>
      <h3><a name="q18" id="q18">How do I import
ROM/Circle/other areas
(*.are)?</a></h3>
      <p>Check out the IMPORT
command. Logged in as your Archon, enter AHELP IMPORT.</p>
      <h3><a name="q19" id="q19">Why isn't my variable
equipment
working?</a></h3>
      <p>Equipment which is placed
on a mob and designated as variable
will not disappear so long as an Archon, or anyone else with CMDROOMS
or ORDER security privileges is the in the same room as them.</p>
      <h3><a name="q20" id="q20">How do I make a Classless
version of
CoffeeMud?</a></h3>
      <p>The CoffeeMud.ini file
has a parameter called DISABLE. If
CLASSES is added to the disable parameter, then CoffeeMud will skip the
class selection process at logon, and automatically set the player to
the normally dormant class called "PlayerClass". This class, by
default, qualifies for all skills. If you'd like to have the
PlayerClass qualify for only a certain subset of skills, you will need
to either modify PlayerClass.java, or create a new GenCharClass called
"PlayerClass" and give it your own set of skills to qualify for. If you
want, you can create certain races for which there is no character
class by setting the CLASSLESS flag within your GenRace or custom coded
Race.</p>
      <p>This will also skip the
class selection process for new
players, and automatically select a class which (despite the DISABLE
flag) the race qualifies for. See StdRace.java for how to code the
classless() flag in races. See the section on GenCharClasses above for
information on racial class qualifying.</p>
      <h3><a name="q21" id="q21">How do I make a Levelless
version of
CoffeeMud</a></h3>
      <p>The CoffeeMud.ini file
has a parameter called DISABLE. If
LEVELS is added to the disable parameter, then CoffeeMud will not allow
any player to gain or lose levels, either magically or through normal
means, despite any experience points that may be gained or lost.
Individual classes and races can also be designated as being
"levelless" through either coding custom classes and races, or through
the GenRace/GenCharClass creation process. See StdRace.java or
StdCharClass.java for how to code the classless() flag in java. See the
section on GenCharClasses or GenRaces above for information on how to
do it through that interface. Note that adding LEVELS to the DISABLE
flag does not prevent gaining or losing experience, but just the
leveling consequences.</p>
      <h3><a name="q22" id="q22">How do I make a Levelless
AND
Experience Pointless version of CoffeeMud?</a></h3>
      <p><strong>A.</strong>
The CoffeeMud.ini file has a parameter
called DISABLE. If EXPLESS and LEVELS are added to the disable
parameter, then CoffeeMud will not allow any player to gain or lose
experience points or levels, either magically or through normal means.
Individual classes and races can also be designated as being
"levelless" and "expless" through either coding custom classes and
races, or through the GenRace/GenCharClass creation process. See
StdRace.java or StdCharClass.java for how to code the classless() and
expless() flags in java. See the section on GenCharClasses or GenRaces
above for information on how to do it through that interface.</p>
      <h3><a name="q23" id="q23">How do I make a Raceless
version of
CoffeeMud?</a></h3>
      <p>The CoffeeMud.ini file
has a parameter called DISABLE. If
RACES is added to the disable parameter, then CoffeeMud will skip the
race selection process at logon, and automatically set the player to
the normally dormant class called "PlayerRace". Individual classes can
also be designated as being "raceless" through either coding custom
classes , or through the GenCharClass creation process. See
StdCharClass.java for how to code the raceless() flag in java. See the
section on GenCharClasses above for information on how to do it through
that interface.<br />
      <br />
      </p>
      <h3><a name="stddelete" id="q23">How do delete all the stock
class or races and make my own?</a></h3>
      <p>The CoffeeMud.ini file
has a parameter called DISABLE. If
STDRACES and/or STDCLASSES is added to the disable parameter, then
CoffeeMud will not allow players to create characters using any of the
Java-coded races and/or classes. You can also just go into the
com/planet_ink/coffee_mud/CharClasses or
com/planet_ink/coffee_mud/Races directory and delete the Fighter.*
files or Dwarf.* files as well. Whichever way you choose to go, you'll
need some races and/or classes to replace the ones you are leaving out.
&nbsp;You can do this through the MUDGrinder or the command line.
&nbsp;Check the Builders Guide for information on generic Classes, and
the Archon's Guide for information on generic Races. &nbsp;If you use
the DISABLE flag route, remember that it will also keep players from
choosing any of your own Java-coded classes or races as well. &nbsp;If
you need to add races back in, consider converting them to "generic"
versions from the MUDGrinder or command line.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
Another way to make a standard race or class unavailable for players to
choose is by converting the race to generic, and then changing the
Availability to either "Unavailable" or "Skill Only".</p>
      <h3><a name="q24" id="q24">How do I make an item that
never loses
Condition?</a></h3>
      <p>There are a couple of
ways. One is to place Chant_Unbreakable
on the item as permanent Effect. Another way is to change the items
Magical Ability score, and turn on its Is Magical disposition flag on.
This will make the item more resistant to mundane damage.</p>
      <h3><a name="q25" id="q25">How can I make food that
doesn't rot?</a></h3>
      <p>The only kinds of food
that rot are those from the class
GenFoodResource, which are materials FLESH or VEGETATION. The easiest
way to make food that doesn't spoil then is to make it out of GenFood
instead of GenFoodResource, or to change its material from FLESH or
VEGETATION to something else. Another way is to make the resource
magical by turning on its Is Magical disposition flag.</p>
      <h3><a name="q26" id="q26">Whats coming down the road
for
CoffeeMud?</a></h3>
      <p>Some day in the distant
future, CoffeeMud will support three
different genres representing three different KINDS of games. One will
be the Fantasy game that it supports now, which involves the
improvement of a player character through skills and leveling. Another
will be a Technical/Science Fiction game involving the accumulation of
wealth and power in outer space and in other ways. A third will be a
Modern/Fantasy Hero game involving players pitting their wits against
each other in engine-moderated contests. The Hero game will feature
super heroes and villains.</p>
      <h3><a name="q27" id="q27">Whats with the Space Ship
Stuff?</a></h3>
See the answer to the previous question.<br />
      <h3><a name="q28" id="q28">Whats with the Heroics and
Technical
settings on Areas, Classes, and Races?</a></h3>
See the answer to the previous question.
      <h3><a name="q29" id="q29">Whats with the Electronics
stuff?</a></h3>
      <p>See the previous question
on whats coming down the road for
CoffeeMud. The answer to the last question is no -- none of it works
yet, but it will some day.</p>
      <h3><a name="q30" id="q30">How do I make a mob that
doesn't rejuv
after he is killed?</a></h3>
      <p>Setting a mobs REJUV
setting to 0 will prevent him from
automatically resetting. Not saving him in the room he started in will
make this permanent across engine reboots.</p>
      <h3><a name="q31" id="q31">Does CoffeeMud have an
Overland Map
ability?</a></h3>
      <p>Yes, there are two ways. The easiest is to set AWARERANGE in
coffeemud.ini to something higher than 0. The other way is to check out
the
Regional Awareness skill. It is restricted
in the base distribution, but can easily be made generally available to
all players.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you want to do this
programmatically, just open up the file
resources/skills/allqualifylist.txt
and add a line like:</p>
list therein:
      <pre>1 Skill_RegionalAwareness<br /></pre>
      <p>If you want to do this
through the MUDGrinder, you'll have to modify each and every one of
your character classes, and qualify them all for
Skill_RegionalAwareness.</p>
      <h3><a name="q32" id="q32">How do I make a particular
resource
available for Foraging/Chopping/etc in a particular room?</a></h3>
      <p>Check out the
ResourceOverride behavior.</p>
      <h3><a name="q33" id="q33">Can players have their own
shops?</a></h3>
      <p>Yes, in several different
ways. One is for the player to gain
the Marketeering skill. This allows them to become shopkeepers, sell
their goods, and set prices for their goods. Another is to "purchase" a
ShopKeeper-type mob being sold with the property Prop_Retainable. A mob
sold with that property will take up permanent residence at the players
home, and sell the items that are given to them. Money made in this way
will go to a bank account (see StdBanker) held by the owner of the
property. A third way is through Conquest. If the player belongs to a
Clan, and that clan conquers an Area which has the Conquerable Behavior
on it, the shopkeepers therein will become beholden to the leaders of
that clan, selling any items they give to them.</p>
      <h3><a name="q34" id="q34">Can clans buy healers and
such?</a></h3>
      <p>Yes. Put a healer mob up
for sale at a shop. The healer mob
should have the appropriate behaviors and skills to make them a healer
(such as Healer, or NiceAbilities behaviors) and the Prop_Retainable
property. That last will make it so that the player is forced to pay
the mob for his services, and makes sure that the mob is saved at the
players home.</p>
      <h3><a name="q35" id="q35">How can my players
sell their raw gathered resources?</a></h3>
      <p>Create a shopkeeper that sells hides, lumber, metal, rocks or
some combination of those. Next, if you like, use Shop Item Pricing to
make resources (-javaclass +GenResource +GenFoodResource
+GetLiquidResource) more valuable than normal.</p>
      <h3><a name="q36" id="q36">How
can I have a
command like ROM's "SCAN" for seeing in
multiple rooms?</a></h3>
      <p>Give every class the skill "Spell_Farsight" or
"Skill_RegionalAwareness", depending on what you are after.
&nbsp;Farsight lets them see into adjacent rooms. &nbsp;Regional
Awareness lets them get see the gist of the entire outdoor area with
little graphic characters.</p>
      <h3><a name="q38" id="q36">How can I delete Player Classes I
don't want?</a></h3>
      <p>From the MUDGrinder or Command Line, you simply need to modify
each class you don't want and convert them into a Generic Class
(GenClass). &nbsp;This will allow you to alter their availability to
Never be available.</p>
      <h3><a name="q39" id="q37">How can I delete Player Races I don't
want?</a></h3>
      <p>From the MUDGrinder or Command Line, you simply need to modify
each race you don't want and convert them into a Generic Race
(GenRace).
&nbsp;This will allow you to alter their availability to Never be
available, or available only from skills.</p>
