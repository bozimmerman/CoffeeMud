      <h2><a name="application">Application Information:</a></h2>
      <p>CoffeeMud
is written in 100% Java, listening as a server on any specified
port(s). Built-in web servers can be activated to listen on specified
ports.
CoffeeMud supports any JDBC/ODBC database and has been successfully
tested using MySQL, MariaDB, HSQLDB,&nbsp;Derby/Cloudscape, IBM DB2,
Oracle,&nbsp;Access, and Microsoft SQL Server. The package also
includes a flat-file JDBC system for
beginners.</p>
      <p>The
system includes an API that allows standard MOBs, Items, Weapons,
Armor, Room types, Exit types, and Magic Items to be coded in less than
a hundred lines using a template. Generic MOBS, Items, Weapons, Armor,
and Exit types can be be molded to fit any design and spec. &nbsp;They
can be coded in Java or JavaScript, or configured using visual editors
for the non-coders.&nbsp; And all of
it can be implemented online at run-time.</p>
      <p>An
advanced message passing system lies at the systems core. Messages are
customized for the message source, message target, and how that message
appears to everyone else in the room. Each message is coded with basic
sensory information so that only the blind miss visual messages, while
they don't miss the auditory ones. Messages can also be previewed and
modified by every object involved, lending even more environmental
realism to coding!</p>
