<p><b>The CoffeeMUD Web Server:</b><br>
The CoffeeMUD Web Server is a simple, extensible
web server that runs as part of CoffeeMUD; it uses HTTP 1.0
to communicate with a web browser. In addition to being able to
serve standard HTML web pages, it allows mime-types to be specified
for any file extension; it also supports a simple server-processed form of HTML
called <i>CMVP</i> (Coffee MUD Virtual Pages) - this allows the server
to insert information into the page before sending it to the browser.
It is NOT intended to be a full-blown web server! This document assumes you have
some familiarty with HTTP, mime types, and stuff like that.</p>
<P><STRONG>How to Connect:</STRONG><BR>By default, the public web site listens
on port 27744 and the administrative web site on port 27777.&nbsp; To browse the
default public web site, just open up the following URL in your
browser:<BR><BR><A
href="http://localhost:27744/">http://localhost:27744/</A></P>
<P>To connect to the administrative web site, use the following URL:</P>
<P><A href="http://localhost:27777/">http://localhost:27777/</A></P>

<p><b>What it does and doesn't do:</b><br>
It
only supports GET, urlencoded POST&nbsp;and HEAD
requests (I think HEAD is HTTP 1.1, but it's supported anyway).&nbsp;
It does not cache.
</p>

<p><b>Security:</b><br>
In the default CoffeeMUD installation, the server named admin&nbsp;may be&nbsp;bound to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) - this
means it will not accept external connections (see below).<br>
The servers will not permit access to a directory or file outside their base directory tree (which
includes mounted virtual directories, see below); attempts will generate a log message and return
a HTTP 401.
</p>


<p><b>Configuration:</b><br>
The default installation of CoffeeMUD has two inbuilt web servers, named 'pub' and 'admin'.
The web servers are enabled with the line 'RUNWEBSERVERS=true' in 'coffeemud.ini'; any other
value or the abscence of this line will cause the web servers not to be loaded.</p>
<p>INI files for the web servers live in the 'web/' directory off the CoffeeMUD root; by default,
all pages to be served go in <I>web/(servername)/</I>, though this can be overridden.
Options are placed in either 'web/common.ini' or 'web/(servername).ini'; an option in the latter
will override one in common.
The options are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>PORT</b>=xx :
			<b>[REQUIRED]</b>
			<i>(e.g. PORT=80)</i>
			Sets the port number the web server will listen for HTTP requests on;
			this cannot be the same port as the main MUD server or another web servers.
			Identical to MUD server usage.
			Normally this would go in <I>web/(servername).ini</I>.
	<li><b>BACKLOG</b>=xx :
			<i>(e.g. BACKLOG=10)</i>
			Sets the number of requests that can be
			queued by the internal TCP/IP stack. Identical to MUD server usage.
	<li><b>BIND</b>=addr :
			<i>(e.g. BIND=127.0.0.1)</i>
			Causes the server to be bound to a
			specific address; this is useful on multi-homed machines or if you wish to prevent
			public access to the pages. Identical to MUD server usage.<br>
			<b>The Admin server should be bound to localhost (or 127.0.0.1) unless you really know
			what you're doing...</b>

	<li><b>DEFAULTFILE</b>=filename :
			<b>[REQUIRED]</b>
			<i>(e.g. DEFAULTFILE=index.html)</i>
			Sets the default filename to be appended if none is specified in the
			request (or the request refers to a directory - in which case the browser
			will get a 401 Unauthorized rather than a 404 Not Found if this file doesn't exist).
	<li><b>VIRTUALPAGEEXTENSION</b>=.xxxx :
			<b>[REQUIRED]</b>
			<i>(e.g. VIRTUALPAGEEXTENSION=CMVP)</i>
			Allows you to change the file extension for server-processed files to whatever takes
			your fancy. Note that the leading dot is required; you should
			set MIME.xxxx=text/html, unless you're being clever and serving server-processed plaintext
			or something. At the moment, the web server only supports one VIRTUALPAGEEXTENSION.
	<li><b>MIME.xxxx</b>=.yyyy/zzzz :
			<b>[A GOOD IDEA TO SPECIFY!]</b>
			<i>(e.g. MIME.HTML=text/html, MIME.JPEG=image/jpg)</i>
			Allows you to specify a mime type for file extension xxxx;
			some useful mime types include <code>text/html</code>, <code>text/plain</code>, <code>image/gif</code>
			and <code>image/jpg</code>.  If no
			mime type is specified for an extension, it defaults to <code>application/octet-stream</code> -
			which is to say, raw binary; for this reason, it's usually a good idea to specify
			at least <code>MIME.HTM=text/html</code> and <code>MIME.HTML=text/html</code> -
			it's also good manners to specify <code>MIME.CLASS=application/octet-stream</code> if you
			intend to be running java applets on the web pages.
			Normally these would be placed in <I>web/common.ini</I>.
	<li><b>ADMIN</b>=   true : allows admin macros to run on this server (see below).
	<li><b>BASEDIRECTORY</b>=path : allows you to override the web-page directory that this server
			uses - default is <i>web/(servername)</i>. Servers can share base directories.
	<li><b>TEMPLATEDIRECTORY</b>=path : allows you to override the web-page template directory that this server
			uses - default is BASEDIRECTORY + <i>.templates</i>.
			The template directory is where pages such as <I>error.cmvp</I> are
  placed. Servers can share template directories.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Virtual Directories:</b><br>
This is a quick-and-dirty directory mounting method; using an operating-system specific method would
be preferable. Nevertheless, you can specify <B>MOUNT/virtualdir=physicaldir</B> in a server cfg file;
for example, <B>MOUNT/guides=guides</B> creates a virtual directory with access to the player guides.<br>
Now the limitation - URLs that do things like this: <B>/guides/..</B> won't work; this means you can't
link BACK from a virtual directory with a RELATIVE link, unless you rely on the user's browser to preprocess the URL and
remove redundancies; instead, specify a path from the root ('/') -
e.g., instead of ../index.cmvp specify /index.cmvp.
</p>
<P><b>CoffeeMUD Virtual Pages:</b><br>
  Kind of misnamed (these pages in their original, very
different incarnation didn't exist at all), this is typically a HTML or
plaintext file that is preprocessed by the server before being dispatched to the
browser. Preprocessing is a simple search-and-replace; NO ACCOUNT is taken of
where the macro appears within the file (ie, macros within comments or quoted
strings will be replaced). </P>
<P>Macros are always surrounded by the AT sign (@), and are thus delineated in
the page.&nbsp; Any parameters required for a macro always follow the macro name
and a Question Mark (?).&nbsp; Further parameters are separated by the Ampersand
(&amp;) character.&nbsp; Each parameter may optionally be an equation, where the
name is on the left of an equal sign, and its value on the right.&nbsp; An
example of all this in action would be:</P>
<P>@MacroName?PARAMETER&amp;PARM2=VALUE&amp;PARM3@</P>
<P>Macros may be embedded in each other ONLY if the embedded macros are part of
the parameters of the host macro, which means they must follow&nbsp;the Question
Mark.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, for each level of embedding, an extra At sign (@)
character is used around the macro.&nbsp; To avoid confusion, the closing At
signs (@) should be separated by spaces.&nbsp; Here is an example of embedded
Macros (in this case, two macros are used for each of two parameters to a first
macro (MacroOne):</P>
<P>@MacroOne?@@MacroTwo?PARM@@&amp;@@MacroThree?PARM@@ @</P>
<P>Notice the space before the final At sign (@).&nbsp; Now, here is an example
of double-embedding, where MacroThree is embedded as the parameter to MacroTwo,
which is embedded as the parameter to MacroOne:</P>
<P>@MacroOne?@@MacroTwo?@@@MacroThree?PARM@@@ @@ @</P>
<P>Here are the macros defined so far.&nbsp; Keep in mind
the difference between a Macro parameter (things which follow the first Question mark in a
macro), and a Request Parameter (data submitted from a &lt;FORM&gt; on a
web page, or on the URL line of a GET request).&nbsp; Macro parms will
be abbreviated to MacParm, while Request Parameters will be abbreviated to ReqParm.</P>

  <P><b>Customising the error page:</b><br>
Simply create a file <I>error.cmvp</I> (or
whatever the v.p. extension is) in the template directory of the server; at some
point on the page you should use the @HTTPSTATUS@ and @HTTPSTATUSINFO@ macros.
Note that the template directory is served as though it were in the specified
path - images and stylesheets should therefore go in the server's base
directory.</P>

<p><b>Adding new macros to CMVP:</b><br>
Create the new .java file in the <I>com/planet_ink/coffee_mud/web/macros</I> directory; all classes
in this directory are loaded as macros by default.<br>
The new class should inherit from <code>StdWebMacro</code> in the
<I>com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.web</I> package.<br>
The package of the new class should be <I>com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.web.macros</I>; the
<code>name()</code> member should return the name of your new macro
(it will be capitalised and the @ symbols added by StdWebMacro) - the name doesn't have to match
the class name but it is recommended to avoid confusion.<br>
Finally, the <code>runMacro()</code> function returns the String data you wish to insert into the processed
output; it takes a single parameter, a reference to the <i>ProcessWebRequest</i> that is calling
the macro (you can use <code>.getWebServer()</code> on this parameter to get a reference to
the web server, and <code>.getWebServer().getMUD()</code> to get a reference to the main MUD object).<br>
If <code>runMacro()</code> returns <I>null</I>, the string [Error] is used to replace the macro; also
note that <B>macros may not return other macros in the processed text unless properly embedded as discussed above.</B>
</p>
Example: this is the complete code for the <B>@HTTPCLIENTIP@</B> macro (HTTPclientIP.java):
<pre>package com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.web.macros;
import com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.interfaces.*;
import com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.common.*;
import com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.utils.*;

public class HTTPclientIP extends StdWebMacro
{

	public String name() {return "HTTPclientIP";}

	public String runMacro(ExternalHTTPRequests httpReq, String parms)
	{
		return httpReq.getHTTPclientIP();
	}

}
</pre>
<P>
The <code>.getHTTPclientIP()</code> member of ProcessWebRequest	essentially just does
this:</P>
<pre>
	return sock.getInetAddress().getHostAddress();
</pre>
<P>
(don't be confused by the name <code>.getHostAddress()</code> - this just returns the
dotted quad notation form of the address, whereas
<code>.toString()</code> would attempt to do a reverse DNS(?) and
return a meaningful name as well) </P>
<P>
If your macro is intended to be for the admin server only, you can override the
<code>.isAdminMacro()</code> member to return <code>true.</code></P>
<P><CODE></CODE>&nbsp;</P>
