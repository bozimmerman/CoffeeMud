      <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction to
Random Generation</a></h2>
      <p>Random
generation in the realm of mud areas, rooms,
items, mobs, and so forth is a strange proposition. &nbsp;In the
end, it always boils down to selecting among known, fixed, and constant
alternatives that make sense in a particular context. &nbsp;For
example, a mob that might be named "George" or "A path in the forest"
is certainly random, but doesn't make much sense, so we tend to
restrict our alternatives in some way. &nbsp;Also, selecting evenly
among alternatives, while certainly the most common thing you will do,
also sometimes doesn't make sense. &nbsp;A random Moon description
might include words like "full", "new", "crescent", "half", and "BLUE".
&nbsp;However, just because you want the "BLUE" alternative to be
available, doesn't mean you want it to have an equal chance of
describing your moon as the other choices. &nbsp; Also, sometimes
the context in which an alternative makes sense can be extremely
narrow. &nbsp;Having "a rat" as a random monster in your dungeon
almost always makes sense, except in the "cat room". &nbsp;Again,
judgement must come into play. And lastly, the more random a particular
area is, the more it will seem like every other random area.
&nbsp;Randomness is best used to select overall themes for an area,
which the content reflects, as opposed to every room having random
content and descriptions.</p>
      <p>All of these considerations and more have gone into the
devising of a random mud engine, and particularly to the format of the
input data it uses. &nbsp;This engine receives a series of sets of
alternatives which may include a relative weight for each alternative,
and potentially the context in which each alternative applies or
doesn't apply, and then makes selections and instantiates&nbsp;real
mud objects based on those selections. &nbsp;The input to the
engine is a very specifically built XML file, and the output is actual
mud objects (mobs, items, areas, rooms, or all the above) in your game.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
      <h2><a name="structure">Overview of
XML Tags</a></h2>
The random generator works by
reading a
specially-written XML document
that contains tags describing the object or objects to generate.
&nbsp;For example, area generation looks for tags named
&lt;AREA /&gt;, mobs for &lt;MOB /&gt;, items for
&lt;ITEM /&gt;, rooms for &lt;ROOM /&gt;, and so forth.
&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
The embedding of tags can&nbsp;also be significant. &nbsp;For
example, to generate a mob from a given &lt;MOB /&gt; tag, the
tag must either contain a NAME attribute, or a &lt;NAME /&gt;
tag embedded inside the &lt;MOB /&gt; tag. &nbsp;Another
example would be that<br />
room tags may contain mob and item tags.<br />
      <br />
Generation sometimes requires that a specific starting object be named
by ID, in which case an ID attribute may be found on the tag, allowing
it to be referenced globally, no matter where it is embedded.<br />
      <br />
The basic&nbsp;tag types are AREA, ROOM, MOB, ITEM, and STRING.
&nbsp;Any tag that contains other tags of the same tag type is a
Container tag, and usually has rules in the form of special attributes
for how to select among the alternatives in the container. &nbsp;In
cases where one of something is called for, but multiple options are
available, and no rules are found for how to select among them, a
random roll will be made. &nbsp;In cases where one or more of
something is allowed, and multiple options are available, all the
alternatives found will be selected.<br />
      <br />
Each basic tag type is used to build an object of that type.&nbsp;
For
instance, the MOB tag is used to build a MOB.&nbsp; Therefore, each
basic
object type must have other tags or attributes to "fill in the
details", such as name, level, and so forth.&nbsp; These Details
may be
defined as variables on the command line using GENERATE or by the
"define" attribute, or may be given as an attribute of the basic tag,
or as other tags inside the parent tag.&nbsp; A Detail given as an
attribute
always supersedes any detail given as internal tags, no matter
what.&nbsp; A
detail found as an defined variable identifier, supersedes both tags and<br />
attributes. &nbsp;See the glossary for more tails on each major tag
type.<br />
      <br />
Basic
tags may also have special pre-defined variables to help give some
context to help with their parsing, and will often cause variables to
be defined as their details are filled in.&nbsp; Basic tags also
have
certain required details which must be resolved for the<br />
object to be created, and other optional details which may or may not
be given, and which are extremely object-specific. &nbsp;Again, the
glossary entry for each basic tag type will have more information about
this.<br />
      <br />
Tags are always evaluated recursively, from first to last.
&nbsp;Any tag may contain zero or more of the following
meta-attributes:<br />

evaluate to true for the tag to be included in its parent.&nbsp;
This is similar to "validate" except that "condition" determines
whether a tag is among the allowed choices,&nbsp;whereas "validate"
determines whether, after being chosen, it is finally built into a
final thing (whether string, mob, item, whatever). &nbsp;These
expressions may use boolean operators like AND and OR and NOT (or
!),&nbsp;string constants are always single-quoted 'string', string
comparison&nbsp;operators include = , !=, and IN to check to see if
the lhs string is a&nbsp;substring of the rhs string. Numeric
comparisons may be made as well, and&nbsp; numeric comparison
operators include &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;= != =.&nbsp;
Parenthesis may be&nbsp;used to group sub-expressions. Defined
variables may be included, but only&nbsp;if preceded by a $
character. For instance, to check if the variable "bob"&nbsp;is
equal to "bobvalue", you would enter $bob='bobvalue'.&nbsp;
Undefined string&nbsp;ids are treated as ''.&nbsp; Remember
that in XML, a &lt; and &gt; characters can not&nbsp;appear
in attribute values, which is why they must be written as &amp;lt;
and&nbsp;&amp;gt; in your xml.</td>

              <li>"id": either a new or existing identifier, in

add the number 3 to the current value of&nbsp;the identifier
"bob".&nbsp; Any undefined "id" will be treated as if it were 0.
When dealing with areas, there is an extra feature of defined
identifiers.&nbsp; An identifier whose name starts with "_" will
persist for&nbsp;every tag and object in the room's "room
group".&nbsp; An identifier whose name&nbsp;starts with "__"

A non-container non-basic tag will typically have a string
value.&nbsp; This value may contain any embedded variables or
identifiers, so long as they are preceded with a $ character.<br />
      <br />
A string beginning with a $ character will be assumed to be an
identifier, and will be searched for within the list of defined
variables and identifiers.&nbsp; If the identifier resolves to a
tag, the tag will be parsed as a string.&nbsp; If the identifier
resolves to<br />
a string, so much the easier.<br />

Defined variables or tag names can also be embedded in {} characters;
for example: ${ame}. When embedded in this way, the name may be
preceeded by:<br />

DESCRIPTION, etc...</li>
        <li>${STAT:[PATH]:[TO]:[ANOTHER]:[OBJECT]:[STATNAME]}
embed the value from another objects stat, potentially in a different
room. Where path-to-another-object may be: ROOM to refer to the room
containing the object, NORTH,SOUTH,EAST,WEST,UP,DOWN,NORTHEAST..etc..
to specify a room in a specific direction, ANYROOM to specify any room
connected to this one, MOB to specify any mob in the room, ITEM to
specify any item in the room, AREA to specify the area object, or
AREAGATE to specify a connecting room outside the area.&nbsp; For
example a string such as: "To the east is the residence of
${STAT:ROOM:EAST:MOB:NAME}" would embed the name of a mob in a room to
the east of the current room. This command may internally cause
post-processing if necessary, and so is almost guaranteed to always
work unlike some of the special ROOM_ tags.</li><li>$[FORMULA] to generate a number. &nbsp;For example, $[10 + 5?10]</li>
        <li>(a(n)) will remove any indefinite or definite
articles from the string immediately following it and replace it (or
insert) either "a" or "an" depending on the first letter of the word.</li>

      <h2><a name="using">Using the Random Generator</a></h2>
There are currently two ways to use the Random Generator, one is the
Archon GENERATE command, and the other is the Area type
"StdAutoGenInstance".<br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generate Command</span>:<br />
      <br />
The most straightforward way to access the random generator is using
the Archon GENERATE command. &nbsp;The usage is as follows:<br />
      <br />
GENERATE [OBJ TYPE] [ID] (FROM [FILENAME]) ([VAR]=[VAL]...)
([DIRECTION])<br />
      <br />
This command uses an xml file to generate random content for your
mud.&nbsp; This content can&nbsp;be anything from whole areas,
to rooms, mobs, items, or simple strings. By default,
the&nbsp;content is built from the file in
resources/randareas/example.xml, though the builder&nbsp;may
specify his or her own xml file path as one of the many
arguments.&nbsp; The arguments,&nbsp;briefly, are:<br />

The GENERATE command is an interesting way to deliver large amounts of
dynamic content&nbsp;for your world, though it can never replace
the caring touch of a real, creative builder.&nbsp;
If&nbsp;anyone is interested in writing their own xml content,
please open up the /resources/randareas/example.xml&nbsp;file and
begin reading it and all of the LOADed files. Use those file as an
example on how to construct your own.<br />
      <br />
Examples of the Generate Command: <br />
generate area maze_dungeon from randareas/example.xml areasize=50
areaname=test&nbsp;level_range=10?20 aggrochance=50 theme=kobolds
south<br />
      <br />
generate string list<br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">StdAutoGenInstance
Area Type</span>:<br />
      <br />
The StdAutoGenInstance area type is specially formulated to replace any
rooms of its own with auto-generated rooms and content. &nbsp;<br />
      <br />
This area type is, firstly, an Instance generator. &nbsp;That means
that each group that goes into the area will have their own unique
generated rooms to play in, which will be different from any other
groups, and will persist until the group gets tired of playing it
(causing the area to time-out and be garbage collected).<br />
      <br />
This area type also permits the path and name of the top-level random
generation xml file to be specified, where the /resource directory is
considered the default path root.<br />
      <br />
Lastly, any required or optional variables. Many tags will have a
specific set of required&nbsp;variables which must be defined in
order for
the content to be generated.&nbsp; Failing to specify&nbsp;one
of the required
variables will cause the area generation to fail, putting an error
message in your mud.log file. &nbsp;Variable types which list
numbers&nbsp;as their data types may also have
math expressions values (so you can use random numbers).&nbsp;
See&nbsp;the help
on MATH EXPRESSION for more information on this.&nbsp; In addition
to
required variables, you&nbsp;may also use the space to enter one or
more
"override" values for existing defined things. &nbsp;One special
variable is <span style="font-style: italic;">passivemins</span> which
can be set to the number of minutes an instance will remain passive
before being deleted, with a default of 30 minutes. &nbsp;Another is <span style="font-style: italic;">noreset</span>, which, when set to "true", prevents players from using the special "reset instance" trick.
      <h2><a name="glossary">Glossary of XML Tags</a></h2>
      <p><a name="areatag"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AREA tags</span></a>:
      <br />
As the highest-level possible tag, an area is parsed only with the
variables it is given on the GENERATE command line, and using whatever
it can find in its XML contents for its details.&nbsp; All details
mentioned below will
automatically cause a variable to be defined or re-defined when they
are parsed.&nbsp;
The variable will be called "AREA_DETAILNAME".&nbsp; For instance
"AREA_CLASS" for
class, and "AREA_NAME" for name.<br />
      <br />
The layout of an area will cause its rooms to be logically grouped up
into streets, "leaf" rooms (rooms with only one exist), and other
logical
groupings.&nbsp; "leaf" rooms are always done first, followed by
streets, and others.&nbsp; The
layout will automatically define certain variables for each room to
help with parsing the rooms
details.&nbsp; These variables include:<br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>$AREA_NUMLEAFS: the number of leaf rooms for the
whole area</li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODETYPE: one of surround, leaf, offleaf,
street,
square,
interior</li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODERUN: for streets, which way they
run.&nbsp;
Values are
ns, ew, nwse, nesw</li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODEFLAGS: various rooms flags. Values
include:
corner, gate,
intersection, tee, offleaf </li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODEEXITS: comma separated list of all exits
from
a room</li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODEGATEEXIT: if this room is a "gate"
room,
which direction
is the gate in.</li><li>$ROOMTAG_GATEEXITROOM: if this room is a "gate"
room, which room object does it link to.</li><li>$ROOMTAG_GATEEXITCLASS: if this room is a "gate"
room, which exit object should it use.</li><li>$ROOMTAG_NODEGATEEXIT&lt;dir&gt;: as above, but denoting a gate for direction number &lt;dir&gt;.</li><li>$ROOMTAG_GATEEXITROOM&lt;dir&gt;:&nbsp;as above, but denoting a gate for direction number &lt;dir&gt;.</li><li>$ROOMTAG_GATEEXITCLASS&lt;dir&gt;:&nbsp;as above, but denoting a gate for direction number &lt;dir&gt;.</li>
        <li>$ROOMLINK_N, $ROOMLINK_S, $ROOMLINK_E, $ROOMLINK_W,

"true" if an exit
exists that way.</li>
        <li>$ROOMTITLE_N, $ROOMTITLE_S, $ROOMTITLE_E,
$ROOMTITLE_W,
etc: if already
done, the title of a room that way.</li>

        <dd>The
QUEST tag is supremely unique in that it does not represent an object
in your world, or a property of some object in your world, but instead
represents a relationship between players and your world by giving them
tasks to perform. &nbsp;In the end, a QUEST tag must resolve to a
complete&nbsp;Quest Script document/string, which is then submitted to
CoffeeMud's Quest Manager for execution, monitoring, and cleanup.
&nbsp;I won't go into the complete details of what goes into a Quest
Script here, however. &nbsp;Instead, you should check the Game
Builder's Guide for a complete breakdown of a Quest Script.</dd>
        <dd></dd>
        <dd>Quest
Scripts can be built from the ground up by assembling a String
consisting of each line of the quest script, separated by %0D
characters.<br />
          <br />
Scripts can also be built, however, by utilizing
one of the existing Quest Maker templates. &nbsp;These are the
templates found in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">/resources/quests/templates</span>
directory. &nbsp; They are partially built Quest Scripts which, when
run through the Quest Maker Wizard, can be filled out manually by a
builder. &nbsp;However, those templates can also be run through the
Random Generator to generate randomly what the builder would normally
have to type in manually. &nbsp;<br />
          <br />
To create a quest script by
running a Template through the random generator, you would specify the
full path or ordinary name (e.g. normal_capture1) of the Template in a
tag parameter on the QUEST tag called QUEST_TEMPLATE_ID. &nbsp; When
this is done, the quest script and its variables are extracted from the
template. &nbsp;The variables in the template then become required
details for the QUEST tag. &nbsp;When those details are resolved into
STRINGs, the values are substituted into the template's quest script
and then returned by the tag.<br />
          <br />
To discover the required details for a particular template, you should
open up that template <span style="font-family: monospace;">*.quest</span>
file and scan down the top part of the file whose lines begin with #.
&nbsp;When you see a line that begins with #$, you know you are looking
at a variable definition whose variable name is a required detail for
the QUEST tag using that template.</dd>
        <dd></dd>
        <dd>To save you some
time, numerous existing quest templates have already had associated
snippets of Random Generator XML written to demonstrate the above.
&nbsp;These are found in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">/resources/quests/random</span>
directory, and can be indirectly accessed from the same <span style="font-family: monospace;">/resources/randareas/example.xml</span>
that is used to generate random areas, rooms, mobs, etc. &nbsp;This
means that you can use the GENERATE command to generate a random quest
of any type anywhere in your entire world by entering:<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-family: monospace;">generate quest
all_quests template=normal "expiration=20 minutes"</span><br />
          <br />
The
"template" variable specifies that you want any available quest
template. &nbsp;The "expiration" variable definition ensures that the
quest is not saved to your database, and will in fact be destroyed
after running for 20 minutes. &nbsp;If you leave it off, or replace it
with a "duration" definition (see the Game Builders Guide), then the
quest will be writte to the database and become a persistant feature of
your world.<br />
          <br />
If you look through the examples in <span style="font-family: monospace;">/resources/quests/random</span>
, you will see much that is similar to Random Area documents. Strings
and other selections are being chosen from, conditions are set for some
values over others, etc. &nbsp;However, since many of the quest
Templates actually require that an already existing mob, or item, or
even set of mobs in your world be selected as subjects for the quest,
the Random Generator engine had to be extended to support not only the
creation of new mobs, items, rooms, and areas, but the selection of
existing ones inside the world. &nbsp;To do this, see the next section
on the OBJECT tag.</dd>
      </dl>
      <a name="objecttag"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OBJECT tags</span></a>:
      <br />
      <dl>
        <dd>This
tag type is unique in the sense that it can contain any MOB, ITEM,
AREA, ROOM, or other main object types, intermingled. &nbsp;It is also
unique in that it need not resolve to the creation of any new object at
all, but can instead be used to select from an existing object in your
already existing world.<br />
          <br />
To do the later, the OBJECT tag
value mnust begin with SELECT: and be followed by an MQL query string.
&nbsp;When this is done, the OBJECT tag will take on the properties of
whatever was selected by the query. &nbsp;See the next section on MQL
for how these queries work.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h2><a name="mql">Notes on MQL</a></h2>
      <p>MQL Stands for MUD Query Language. &nbsp;It's purpose is to
allow
the Archon, or a random quest xml document, to select existing objects
in the game, or the properties of existing objects. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>The structure of MQL is similar to SQL in that all MQL
statements are of this structure: <br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">SELECT:</span>
[property, property, ..] <span style="font-family: monospace;">FROM</span>
[object set] &nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">WHERE</span>
[object comparison, object comparison]<br />
* note the colon : after the word SELECT above.</p>
      <p>The SELECT clause defines the properties you wish to be
returned from the MQL statement.<br />
The FROM clause defines the set of objects that you might want to
return the properties of.<br />
The
WHERE clause defines the conditions under which any member of the set
in the FROM clause may be included in the final results.</p>
      <p>A FROM clause can be a simple world set term, such as one of
the following:<br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A CMFS file path to a CMARE file, such as :<span style="font-family: monospace;">:/resources/map/plains.cmare</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">AREAS</span> to use
the set of all world areas</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">ROOMS</span> to use
the set of all existing world rooms</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">NPROOMS</span> to use
the set of all existing world non-property rooms</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">MOBS</span> to use
the set of all existing world mobs</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">ITEMS</span> to use
the set of all existing world items</li>
        <li>In case where a qualifying object is implied, <span style="font-family: monospace;">AREA</span> can be used to refer to
that specific area.</li>
        <li>Another SELECT: statement in parenthesis, such as: <span style="font-family: monospace;">SELECT: name from (SELECT * from AREA)</span></li>
      </ul>
The
FROM clause can also include narrowing suffixes. &nbsp;A narrowing
suffix comes after the&nbsp;simple term, and is separated from it by a
backslash \. &nbsp; For example, if your from clause looks like <span style="font-family: monospace;">SELECT * FROM AREAS\ROOM</span>
&nbsp;, then the ROOM portion is the narrowing suffix of the AREAS
term. &nbsp;You can also continue adding more narrowing suffixes as
needed. &nbsp;For example: <span style="font-family: monospace;">SELECT
* FROM AREAS\MOBS\EQUIPMENT</span>
&nbsp;. &nbsp;Each suffix narrows or alters the term immediate before
it, and the entire FROM clause will end up reflecting the type of
object described by the final term, whether it be simple, or a
narrowing term.<br />
      <br />
The following are useful narrowing terms:<br />
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">AREAS</span> to use
the unique set of areas in which the prior term is located</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">ROOMS</span> to use
the unique set of rooms in which the prior term is located, or which
the prior term contains</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">NPROOMS</span> to use
the unique set of rooms in which the prior term is located, or which
the prior term contains, excepting any private property rooms</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">EXITS</span> to use
the unique set of exits in which the prior term is located, or which
the prior term contains</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">MOBS&nbsp;</span>to
use mobs in a room or area, or nearby mobs for others</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">MOB</span> to
use the set of all mob&nbsp;contained in the prior term, or ensure the
simple Mob result of a query</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">ITEMS</span> to
use all items in a roow or area, or nearby items for others</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">ITEM</span> to
use the set of all items contained in the prior term, or ensure the
simple Item result of a query</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">OWNER</span> to use
the set of all item owners of the prior term, if it was items</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">FACTIONS</span> to
use a set of all mob factions, where ID is the faction id, and VALUE is
the numeric value</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">PLAYERS, PLAYER</span>
to use the set of all players contained in the prior term</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">RESOURCES</span> to
use the racial or material components of a mob or item</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">NPCS&nbsp;</span>to
use the set of all non-player mobs in a room or area, or nearby npcs
for others</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">NPC</span> to
use the set of all non-player mobs contained in the prior term, or
ensure the simple Mob result of a query<br />
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">EQUIPMENT</span> to
use the set of all &nbsp;worn items of the prior term</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">ABILITIES</span> to
use the set of all &nbsp;abilities of the prior term</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">PROPERTIES</span> to
use the set of all &nbsp;uninvokable effects of the prior term</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">EFFECTS</span> to
use the set of all &nbsp;permanent or temporary effects on the prior
term</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">BEHAVIORS</span> to
use the set of all &nbsp;behaviors of the prior term</li>
      </ul>
Be
careful when using narrowing terms to make sure they make sense for the
term prior to them. &nbsp;For example, if importing mobs from a cmare
file, AREAS will not likely resolve to anything, since the mobs aren't
in the world yet.<br />
      <br />
The SELECT: clause can include one or more
comma-delimited properties of &nbsp;the objects in the from clause, or
it can be an asterisk *, or a period ., to refer simply to the FROM
objects themselves. &nbsp;It can also be a string or numeric literal,
or an XML tag when embedding MQL in a random quest document.&nbsp;
&nbsp; Different kinds of objects have different kinds of properties,
so it is tricky to define precisely what a legal and illegal object
property might be. &nbsp;Choosing incorrectly will usually just result
in an empty string "".<br />
      <br />
To summarize, valid property terms include:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>A valid property of an object from the FROM set, e.g <span style="font-family: monospace;">NAME</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">CLASS</span>, etc..<br />
        </li>
        <li>A string or numeric literal, e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;">"Bob The Builder"</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">12.34</span>, etc..</li>
        <li>An asterisk * or a period . to refer to the FROM set object
itself.</li>
        <li>Another MQL statement, e.g.<span style="font-family: monospace;"> (SELECT: * FROM areas\mobs)</span></li>
        <li>An XML tag id, e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;">$tagname</span></li>
      </ul>
An example of a legal property might
be the property CLASS, since it applies to everything from areas and
rooms, to mobs, and items. &nbsp;NAME is also a property that almost
all objects have. &nbsp;Beyond this. using the GMODIFY command might be
the simplest way to get a list of valid properties for a specific type
of world object, or objects imported from cmare files. &nbsp;<br />
      <br />
As
mentioned previously, SELECT: clause properties can be separated by
commas in order to select more than one. &nbsp;For example: <span style="font-family: monospace;">SELECT: class, name FROM areas\mobs</span>
would show the class id and name of every mob in your game. &nbsp;<br />
      <br />
SELECT:
clauses can also include an AS qualifier for each property selected.
&nbsp;This has only the effect of changing the apparent name of the
property for other parts of the system. &nbsp;For an example using the
WHERE command to issue MQL: <span style="font-family: monospace;">WHERE
AREA SELECT: class as classid, name as mob_name FROM areas\mobs&nbsp;</span>would
show the same results as the previous example statement, but with
different name tags for the class and name properties. &nbsp;This might
be important when using an embedded SELECT: statement as your FROM
clause, since you can only select properties that the embedded clause
has returned, by the names they were given.<br />
      <br />
SELECT: clauses,
similar to FROM clauses above, can include narrowing terms. &nbsp;Like
FROM clauses, these narrowing terms are separated by backslashes \.
&nbsp; SELECT clauses, at the moment, only support one narrowing term:
COUNT. &nbsp;The purpose of the COUNT term is to report the number of
times the value of the previous terms appears in the rest of the FROM:
clause. &nbsp;For example, suppose you wanted to know the number of
times each mob name is used, to do that, you might enter <span style="font-family: monospace;">SELECT: name, name\count FROM
areas\mobs</span><br />
      <br />
Lastly,
SELECT: clause can contain aggregating prefixes before a property term,
which will transform the final result set in some way by aggregating
the rows according to the prefix. &nbsp;Prefixes, like suffixes, are
separated from the property term by a backslash \. &nbsp;The value
aggregating prefixes are:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>MEDIAN to return only the median value of all the property
terms in the existing result set</li>
        <li>MEAN to return the mean value of all the property terms in
the existing result set</li>
        <li>COUNT to return the count of the number of &nbsp;items in
the result set</li>
        <li>UNIQUE to include only one row where the property is of any
given value</li>
      </ul>
For example, to quickly count the mobs in your game, you might enter <span style="font-family: monospace;">SELECT: COUNT\* from AREAS\MOBS</span><br />
      <br />
The
WHERE clause contains one or more conditions, which you can further
compare using connectors like AND, OR, or parenthesis to group
conditions together. &nbsp;Each condition consists of &nbsp;two terms
separated by a comparator. &nbsp;Value comparitors include = (equal
to), &lt;&gt; (not equal to), &gt; (greater than), &lt; (less than),
&gt;= (greater or equal), &lt;= (less or equal), IN (in a set or object
group, or a substring of), or LIKE (matching a ZAPPERMASK).<br />
      <br />
A
condition consists of two property terms, similar to those described in
the SELECT: clause above, except that condition terms can not use
aggregating prefixes. &nbsp;Narrowing suffixes, however, are permitted.
&nbsp;For example <span style="font-family: monospace;">NAME = 'Bob'</span>
is checking whether the NAME property of an item in the FROM clause is
equal to the string literal "BOB". &nbsp;If it is, when that condition
is true. &nbsp;Putting it together then, to show the mobs in your game
whose names are EXACTLY "BOB", you might do <span style="font-family: monospace;">SELECT: * FROM areas\mobs WHERE
name="BOB"</span>. This works because NAME is a property of every mob
in the AREAS\MOBS from set, and can be compared with the word "BOB".<br />
      <br />
Condition
statements are grouped together into conditions using AND or OR.
&nbsp;For example, chaning the above condition to WHERE name="BOB" OR
name="JOE" would expand the number of possible results by one name.
