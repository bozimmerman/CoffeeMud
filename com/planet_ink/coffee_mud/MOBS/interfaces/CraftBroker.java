/**
 * An CraftBroker is a type of ShopKeeper that lists item requests
 * with prices instead of items themselves.  Customers who have
 * the listed item can then sell it to the broker for the listed price,
 * after which the actual item will be available for the original
 * requester to buy.  The CraftBroker, of course, also takes his cut.
 *
 * CraftBrokers belong to a broker chain, so that players need only
 * visit the broker nearest them to see all the requests.
